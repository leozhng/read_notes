1. Literature search and study collection

   - Pre-register / open science [osf.io]

   - start: 2012 Jan 1 (Science) ; end: 2019 Oct 1

   - key words: 

   - search strategies

     - Databases: Web of Science, PsycInfo, PsycARTICLES, Dissertation, Google Scholar
- Reference lists of relevant papers, reviews, or meta-analysis
     - Relevant journals: Science, Nature, PNAS, Psychological Science, Journal of Consumer Psychology etc.
- Searching abstracts and keywords from databases using the following combination of words: (*scarcity* OR *scarcity mindset*) AND (*decision* OR *decision making* OR *decision making*). 
     - We obtained a total of  ? studies with potentially eligible results according to abstracts and keywords.

   - Inclusion criteria: To be included in the meta-analysis, studies needed to meet four criteria. 
  
     - All outcomes had to be assessed with validated measures. 
  
     - the means and standard deviations of interest scores are reported
  - Studies had to be printed or accepted in peer-reviewed journals. 
     - Adequate detail of method, results, and data to calculate effect sizes had to be present for a study to be included. 

2. Extraction:

   - double data extraction
     - Buscemi, N., Hartling, L., Vandermeer, B., Tjosvold, L., & Klassen, T. P. (2006). Single data extraction generated more errors than double data extraction in systematic reviews. *Journal of clinical epidemiology*, *59*(7), 697-703.
