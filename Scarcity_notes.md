- Economic context and hiv vulnerability in adolescents and young adults living in urban slums in kenya: a qualitative analysis based on scarcity theory

Economics is the study of how individuals and societies make choices when resources are scarce, where scarcity is defined as a condition of insufficient or short supply [35]. 

经济学是研究当资源稀缺时个人和社会如何做出选择的[35]，其中稀缺被定义为供应不足或短缺的条件。

- The concept of scarcity

The concept of scarcity is at the center of traditional economics, in which individuals rely on rational decision-making in regards to tangible resources to optimize their benefit. However, behavioral economics adds a more nuanced examination of scarcity that integrates psychology and economics, focusing not only on the physical effects of poverty such as homelessness, hunger, or unemployment, but also on the psychological consequences of resource scarcity such as distress, anxiety, or cognition [40, 41].



稀缺性的概念是传统经济学的核心，在传统经济学中，个体依靠对有形资源的理性决策来优化其利益。然而，行为经济学增加了对稀缺性的一个更为细致的检验，它将心理学和经济学结合起来，不仅关注贫穷的物理效应，如无家可归、饥饿或失业，还关注资源稀缺的心理后果，如痛苦、饥饿和失业。不安，或认知[40，41]。

 

In their discourse on the behavioral economics of scarcity, Mullainathan & Shafir (2013) describe six behavioral phenomena that emerge when people experience scarcity, defined as both real and perceived deficiency, primarily in the form of insufficient financial resources [46]. 

Mullainathan&Shafir（2013）在其关于稀缺性行为经济学的论述中，描述了当人们经历稀缺性时出现的六种行为现象，即真实的和感知的缺陷，主要表现为金融资源不足[46]。

 

One phenomenon is that scarcity preoccupies a person’s thoughts on financial decision-making and reduces the available cognitive capacity or “bandwidth” to reason and retain information for other types of decisions. When people are distracted by financial worries, the resultant bandwidth tax means they are less able to process information in other areas to make decisions [40, 46–49]. 

一种现象是，稀缺性使一个人对财务决策的想法全神贯注，并降低了可用的认知能力或“带宽”，从而为其他类型的决策推理和保留信息。当人们被经济问题分散注意力时，由此产生的带宽税意味着他们无法处理其他领域的信息来做出决定[40，46–49]。

 

Secondly, as their most prominent financial needs gain their attention, it leads them to neglect or tunnel out less prominent needs and consequences which results in decisions that may have harmful effects [41, 46, 48]. 

其次，由于他们最突出的财务需求得到了他们的关注，这导致他们忽视或排除不突出的需求和后果，从而导致可能产生有害影响的决策[41、46、48]。

 

Such pressing financial need can also result in a third phenomenon of myopic borrowing when a person, biased towards present concerns, obtains resources on loan with less consideration of how to return the equivalent resources in the future [46]. 

这种紧迫的财政需求也可能导致第三种短视借贷现象，即一个人偏袒当前的担忧，获得贷款资源，而不考虑如何在未来返还同等资源[46]。

 

Economists commonly refer to this as present bias, a tendency to overly discount future rewards and focus on current temptations at the expense of long-term goals, which can result in self-reinforcing behaviors that lead to persistent scarcity, also known as the “poverty trap” [50–52]. 

经济学家通常将这称为“目前的偏见”，即倾向于过度低估未来的回报，以牺牲长期目标为代价关注当前的诱惑，这可能导致自我强化行为，导致持续的稀缺性，也称为“贫困陷阱”[50-52]。

 

Individuals who perceive that their resources are inadequate relative to their needs also encounter a fourth phenomenon of heightened concern of opportunity costs where purchasing decisions are most sensitive to price [46]. 

那些认为自己的资源相对于自己的需求不足的个人也会遇到第四种现象，即对机会成本的关注度更高，而在这种情况下，采购决策对价格最为敏感[46]。

 

This phenomenon posits that individuals experiencing income shortages are keenly aware of and sensitive to the trade-offs of foregoing one item in order to purchase another [41, 53, 54].

这种现象假定，经历收入短缺的个人敏锐地意识到并对上述一个项目的权衡敏感，以便购买另一个项目。

 

Behavioral economics proposes that this occurs because resource scarcity “captures one’s attention” and places economic decisions at the top of one’s mind [55]. 

行为经济学认为，这是因为资源稀缺“引起人们的注意”，并将经济决策置于人们头脑的顶端[55]。

 

Mullainathan & Shafir (2013) also describe a fifth phenomenon, namely that individuals experiencing scarcity are also more likely to make decisions based on their own budgetary or internal frames of reference rather than external references, such as the purchase place or price marketing [41, 46]. This is important because internal references guide a person’s sense of value [55]. 

Mullainathan&Shafir（2013）还描述了第五种现象，即经历稀缺的个人也更有可能根据自己的预算或内部参考框架而不是外部参考（如购买地点或价格营销）做出决策。

 

Lastly, according to a sixth phenomenon, when scarcity is replaced by excess or slack individuals are better able to exercise choice and make decisions that yield more positive outcomes [46].

最后，根据第六种现象，当稀缺性被过度或懒散所取代时，个人能够更好地进行选择并做出产生更积极结果的决定[46]。

 

In addition, consistent with traditional economics which predicts that a rational response to resource scarcity involves more cautious behaviors, such as saving and decreased spending [56], experimental psychologists suggest that during intermittent periods of excess or slack, individuals with greater resources increase engagement in risk-seeking behaviors to compensate for perceived prior losses during scarce periods [57, 58]. 

此外，与传统经济学预测的对资源稀缺的理性反应包括更谨慎的行为，如储蓄和减少支出[56]相一致，实验心理学家认为，在间歇的过剩或萧条时期，患有GREA的个体资源增加了风险寻求行为的参与度，以补偿在稀缺时期感知到的先前损失[57，58]。

 

This finding among adolescent girls and young women is consistent with the scarcity principle that when scarcity is replaced by excess or slack, individuals are better able to exercise choice and have more cognitive bandwidth to incorporate non-economic preferences, including consideration of less risky options, in their decisions. On the other hand, adolescent boys and young men were described as reducing number of sexual partners and therefore HIV risk only in contexts of resource scarcity.

这一发现与稀缺性原则相一致，即当稀缺性被过度或松弛所取代时，个体能够更好地行使选择权，并有更多的认知带宽来纳入非经济偏好，包括考虑较少的风险的选择，在他们的决定。另一方面，青少年男孩和年轻男性被描述为减少了性伴侣的数量，因此只有在资源匮乏的情况下才有感染艾滋病毒的风险。

 

In scarcity contexts, youth are unlikely to prioritize long-term health goals such as avoiding HIV over short-term survival needs – a rational economic response that can be further aggravated by present bias.

在稀缺的情况下，青年人不太可能优先考虑长期健康目标，如避免艾滋病毒超过短期生存需求，这是一种理性的经济反应，可能会因目前的偏见而进一步加剧。

 

Finally, a third implication relates to noting that HIV rates are lower in Kenya among the rural poor as compared to the urban poor [60, 68, 70], which suggests that economic scarcity alone is not the sole driver of HIV vulnerability. However, urban residents may perceive similar levels of resource scarcity differently than the rural poor given their proximity to urban amenities and wealthier urban residents which are less prominent in rural settings. The theory of scarcity is based in part on perceived scarcity that individuals experience relative to what they consider to be sufficient, which may also be greater among urban compared to rural poor. Research has shown that exposure to resource scarcity cues matters as a trigger for the “scarcity-mindset” and its psychological effects [40, 58].

最后，第三个暗示与注意到肯尼亚农村贫困人口中的艾滋病毒感染率低于城市贫困人口[60、68、70]有关，这表明仅经济短缺并不是艾滋病毒脆弱性的唯一驱动因素。然而，城市居民对资源稀缺程度的感知可能不同于农村贫困人口，因为他们靠近城市便利设施，而在农村环境中不那么突出的富裕城市居民。稀缺性理论部分基于个人相对于他们认为足够的东西所经历的感知的稀缺性，城市中的稀缺性可能比农村穷人更大。研究表明，暴露于资源稀缺性线索是引发“稀缺性心态”及其心理效应的重要因素[40，58]。

# Economic scarcity alters the perception of race

When the economy declines, racial minorities are hit the hardest. Although socioeconomic and health disparities typically exist between White and racial minority Americans (1, 2), these disparities tend to expand dramatically during economic crises.

当经济衰退时，少数民族受到的打击最大。尽管社会经济和健康方面的差异通常存在于白人和少数民族美国人之间（1，2），但这些差异在经济危机期间往往会急剧扩大。

 

For example, during the economic recession of 2007–2009, median household wealth decreased by 16% for White Americans, whereas it decreased by 53% for African Americans (3). These widening disparities are often described in policy circles as an amplification of existing structural and institutional inequalities (4). For example, because of societal disparities in education and income, racial minorities are more likely than majority White Americans to be employed in blue-collar industries—the very industries most vulnerable to economic duress (5, 6). By this account, increased disparities during recession reflect longstanding and unyielding societal structures.

例如，在2007-2009年的经济衰退期间，美国白人家庭财富中位数下降了16%，而非洲裔美国人则下降了53%（3）。这些不断扩大的差距在政策界经常被描述为扩大现有的结构性和制度性不平等（4）。例如，由于教育和收入方面的社会差异，与大多数白人相比，少数民族更有可能受雇于蓝领行业，而蓝领行业是最容易受到经济胁迫的行业（5，6）。根据这一说法，衰退期间的差距扩大反映了长期存在的和坚定不移的社会结构。

 

However, experimental social psychology research suggests that these scarcity effects are not solely a consequence of institutional and societal structures. Indeed, scarce conditions may also influence how one perceives and acts toward others, in ways that change according to one’s particular social goals. 

然而，社会心理学实验研究表明，这些稀缺效应并不仅仅是制度和社会结构的结果。事实上，稀缺的条件也会影响一个人对他人的感知和行为方式，这些方式会根据一个人特定的社会目标而改变。

 

In research on arbitrarily defined social groups (in which structural factors were held constant) scarcity and resource competition fostered distrust and antipathy and promoted discriminatory resource allocations between groups (7–9). Other research has shown that scarcity leads perceivers to devalue another person’s worth and deservingness to justify withholding resources from them (10, 11). 

在对任意定义的社会群体（结构因素保持不变）的研究中，稀缺性和资源竞争导致了不信任和反感，并促进了群体之间的歧视性资源分配（7-9）。另一项研究表明，稀缺性会导致感知者贬低他人的价值，并有资格证明从他们那里截留资源是正当的（10，11）。

 

These findings suggest that economic scarcity changes the way individuals respond to members of other social groups in a manner that facilitates discrimination, beyond the effect of societal structures.

这些发现表明，经济稀缺性改变了个体对其他社会群体成员的反应方式，这种反应方式促进了社会结构影响之外的歧视。

 

How might scarcity effects on social perception contribute to widening racial disparities during economic recession? Prior research has shown that scarcity increases decisions to exclude biracial individuals from the White majority group (12, 13), perhaps to preserve resources. 

在经济衰退期间，稀缺性对社会认知的影响如何导致种族差异扩大？先前的重新调查表明，缺乏增加了将混血儿排除在白人多数群体之外的决定（12，13），也许是为了保护资源。

 

However, mounting evidence suggests that even perceptions of race are malleable and that biases in race perception have implications for the expression of prejudice. That is, although race is often regarded as fixed and veridically perceived (14), representations of a person’s race or ethnicity can shift as a function of the perceiver’s social goals and motivations (15–19). 

然而，越来越多的证据表明，即使是对种族的感知也是有可塑性的，种族感知中的偏见也会影响偏见的表达。也就是说，尽管种族通常被认为是固定的和真实的被感知的（14），但是一个人的种族或种族的表现可以作为感知者的社会目标和动机的一个功能而改变（15-19）。

 

For example, in prior work we found that greater antiegalitarian motives related to the visual perception of African American faces as “Blacker” (20). Such perceptual shifts are consequential: discrimination against African Americans is magnified for those viewed as more prototypically “Black” (i.e., as having darker skin tone and more Afrocentric features) (21), such that they are more likely to be socially excluded, shot when unarmed in a police training task, and sentenced to death after a guilty verdict (22–24). 

例如，在之前的研究中，我们发现，更大的反平均主义动机与非洲裔美国人的脸被视为“更黑”（20）有关。这种感知上的转变是必然的：对非裔美国人的歧视对于那些被视为更典型的“黑人”（即肤色更暗、更具非中心特征的人）来说更为严重（21），他们更有可能被社会排斥，在警察训练任务中手无寸铁被射杀，在有罪判决后被判处死刑。（22-24）。

 

Given these effects, we proposed that economic scarcity may lead perceivers to distort their visual representations of African Americans, seeing them as “Blacker,” which in turn facilitates economic discrimination against them. This hypothesis, which proposes that scarcity shifts the perceptual processing of race (beyond mere shifts in category membership), represents an especially pernicious process through which economic factors promote discrimination. In the studies described herein, we used a psychophysics approach to examine perceptual thresholds and representations of race to rigorously probe the effect of perceived economic scarcity on the visual processing of race.

考虑到这些影响，我们提出经济稀缺可能导致感知者扭曲他们对非洲裔美国人的视觉表达，将他们视为“更黑”，从而促进对他们的经济歧视。这一假设提出稀缺性改变了对种族的感知过程（不仅仅是类别记忆的变化），它代表了一个特别有害的过程，通过这个过程，经济因素促进了歧视。在本文所描述的研究中，我们使用心理物理学的方法来检查感知阈值和种族的表征，以严格地探讨感知的经济稀缺性对种族视觉处理的影响。

 

In an initial test, we examined the relationship between beliefs about economic competition and visual representations of race. Seventy American subjects, none of whom were Black, were recruited for a study on “their ability to determine a person’s racial identity” (Methods). 

 

Zero-sum thinking, also known as zero-sum bias, is a cognitive bias that describes when an individual thinks that one situation is like a zero-sum game, where one person's gain would be another's loss.

 

Our findings also dovetail with recent evidence that scarcity is cognitively taxing (28–30) and thus may undermine an individual’s ability to regulate unintended prejudices. 

我们的研究结果也与最近的证据相吻合，即稀缺性是认知上的负担（28-30），因此可能会削弱个人对非预期偏见的监管能力。

 

Despite egalitarian beliefs, most Americans possess implicit negative associations with minority groups that are kept in check through effortful cognitive control (31, 32). An impairment of control under scarcity could further compound the effects observed in the present research by impairing a perceiver’s ability to control the expression of bias in behavior. 

尽管有自己的信仰，但大多数美国人都与少数群体存在隐性否定关系，这些群体通过努力的认知控制得到控制（31,32）。稀缺性下的控制障碍可能通过削弱感知者控制行为偏倚表现的能力，进一步加剧了本研究中观察到的影响。

 

It is notable, however, that the effects of scarcity on race perception in the present research occurred implicitly (i.e., through nonconscious priming in study 2 and a very subtle between-subjects manipulation of scarcity in study 3), and thus it is unlikely that the observed effects were driven by changes in cognitive control. Nevertheless, cognitive impairment under scarcity could combine with the observed shift in race perception to create a potent impetus for behaviors that bolster existing racial and ethnic disparities.

然而值得注意的是，本研究中稀缺性对种族认知的影响是隐含的（即通过研究2中的无意识启动和研究3中非常微妙的主体之间对稀缺性的操纵），因此不太可能观察到的影响是由认知控制的变化驱动的。尽管如此，稀缺下的认知障碍可能与观察到的种族认知转变相结合，从而为支持现有种族和种族差异的行为创造了强大的推动力。

 

Although scarcity has been shown to affect explicit decisions about an individuals’ group membership (12, 13), our finding that scarcity-elicited perceptual biases operate implicitly suggests that such biases are particularly resistant to detection and, consequently, regulation.

# Some Consequences of Having Too Little 

 

Poor individuals often engage in behaviors, such as excessive borrowing, that reinforce the conditions of poverty. Some explanations for these behaviors focus on personality traits of the poor. Others emphasize environmental factors such as housing or financial access. We instead consider how certain behaviors stem simply from having less. We suggest that scarcity changes how people allocate attention: It leads them to engage more deeply in some problems while neglecting others. Across several experiments, we show that scarcity leads to attentional shifts that can help to explain behaviors such as overborrowing. We discuss how this mechanism might also explain other puzzles of poverty.

穷人经常参与诸如过度借贷等加剧贫困状况的行为。 对这些行为的一些解释集中在穷人的人格特质上。 其他人强调环境因素，如住房或经济准入。 我们反而考虑某些行为是如何仅仅因为拥有更少的行为 我们认为稀缺性改变了人们如何分配注意力：它导致他们更深入地参与某些问题而忽视了其他问题。 在几个实验中，我们表明稀缺性导致注意力转移，这有助于解释诸如过度借贷之类的行为。 我们讨论这种机制如何解释其他贫困问题。

 

The poor often behave in ways that reinforce poverty. For instance, low-income individuals often play lotteries (1, 2), fail to enroll in assistance programs (3), save too little (4), and borrow too much (5). Currently there are two ways to explain this behavior. The first focuses on the circumstances of poverty, such as education (6), health (7), living conditions (8), political representation (9), and numerous demographic and geographic variables (10, 11). Put simply, the poor live in environments (for sociological, political, economic, or other reasons) that promote these behaviors. The second view focuses on personality traits of the poor (12–14). But we suggest a more general view: Resource scarcity creates its own mindset, changing how people look at problems and make decisions.

 

穷人经常表现出加强贫困的方式。 例如，低收入人士经常玩彩票（1,2），没有参加援助计划（3），节省太少（4），借钱太多（5）。 目前有两种方法可以解释这种行为。 第一部分关注贫困的情况，如教育（6），健康（7），生活条件（8），政治代表（9），以及众多的人口和地理变量（10,11）。 简而言之，穷人生活在促进这些行为的环境中（出于社会，政治，经济或其他原因）。 第二种观点侧重于穷人的人格特质（12-14）。 但我们提出了一个更普遍的观点：资源稀缺创造了自己的思维方式，改变了人们对问题的看法和决策。

 

This mindset stems from the most fundamental feature of poverty: having less. And this hypothesis is about scarcity more generally, not just poverty. Indeed, just as expenses capture the attention of the poor, researchers have found that people who are hungry and thirsty focus more on food- and drink-related cues (15, 16). Likewise, the busy (facing time scarcity) respond to deadlines with greater focus on the task at hand (17). Across many contexts, we see a similar psychology. People focus on problems where scarcity is most salient.

这种思维方式源于贫困的最根本特征：拥有更少的贫困。 而这个假设更普遍的是稀缺性，而不仅仅是贫困。 事实上，正如费用引起了穷人的注意，研究人员发现饥饿和口渴的人更关注与食物和饮料有关的暗示（15,16）。 同样，忙碌（面临时间紧缺）对最后期限作出回应，更加关注手头的任务（17）。 在许多情况下，我们看到了类似的心理学。 人们关注的是稀缺性最突出的问题。

 

Attentional neglect appears in many domains. Low-income homeowners often do not attend to regular home maintenance while they focus on more pressing expenses (18). Neglected, these small repairs become major projects. Similarly, in areas where water-borne illness is common, families might focus on pressing daily expenses while failing to procure periodic water treatments (19).

在许多领域出现了注意忽视。低收入的房主通常不会参加定期的家庭维护，而他们专注于更紧迫的开支（18）。被忽视，这些小修理成为重大项目。同样，在水传播疾病很常见的地区，家庭可能会集中精力压制日常开支，而不能定期进行水处理（19）。

 

Attentional neglect can explain another particularly striking behavior: why low-income individuals take short-term, high-interest loans, with interest rates that can approach 800% (20–22). These loans make it easier to meet today’s needs, but the loans’ deferred costs make it difficult to meet future expenses. If scarcity creates a focus on pressing expenses today, then attention will go to a loan’s benefits but not its costs. This suggests a clear prediction: Scarcity, of any kind, will create a tendency to borrow, with insufficient attention to whether the benefits outweigh the costs.

故意忽视可以解释另一个特别引人注目的行为：为什么低收入个人采取短期高息贷款，利率接近800％（20-22）。这些贷款使得更容易满足当今的需求，但贷款的递延成本使得很难满足未来的开支。如果稀缺性使人们关注今天的紧迫开支，那么注意力将集中在贷款的利益上，而不是成本上。这表明了一个明确的预测：任何形式的稀缺都会产生借贷倾向，而没有充分注意利益是否超过成本。

 

 

In experiment 1, 60 participants played a version of Wheel of Fortune (WoF). Scarcity was manipulated by budgeting participants’ chances to guess letters in word puzzles. Poor participants had 84 total guesses (6 per round); rich participants had 280 guesses (20 per round). Previous work suggests that greater engagement in WoF will cause cognitive fatigue and worse performance on subsequent cognitive tasks (28). As a measure of cognitive fatigue, after WoF, participants completed a version of the Dots-Mixed task, which assesses executive functions such as attention and cognitive control (29). Participants responded to visual stimuli presented to the left or right of a fixation cross. On congruent trials, participants had to press a key on the same side as the stimulus; on incongruent trials, they had to press a key on the opposite side. Congruent and incongruent trials (40 each) were randomly presented. Although WoF included a scarcity manipulation, the Dots-Mixed task was identical for all participants.

在实验1中，60名参与者玩了一个名为Wheel of Fortune（WoF）的版本。通过预算参与者在单词拼图中猜字母的机会来操纵稀缺性。参与者总共有84次猜测（每轮6次）;富有的参与者进行了280次猜测（每轮20次）。以前的工作表明，更多参与WoF会导致认知疲劳，并导致后续认知任务的表现更差（28）。作为认知疲劳的衡量标准，在WoF之后，参与者完成了Dots-Mixed任务的一个版本，该任务评估了注意力和认知控制等执行功能（29）。参与者对固定十字架左侧或右侧的视觉刺激作出反应。在一致性试验中，参与者必须按一下与刺激相同的一把钥匙;在不一致的试验中，他们不得不在对面按一把钥匙。随机呈现一致和不一致的试验（每次40个）。尽管WoF包含了稀缺操作，但Dots-Mixed任务对所有参与者来说都是相同的。

 

A simple model of effort might suggest that the rich should be more fatigued because they spent more time and made more guesses playing WoF. In our model, however, the poor would engage more deeply and could be more fatigued despite spending less time.

一个简单的努力模式可能表明富人应该更疲劳，因为他们花更多的时间和作出更多的猜测玩沃夫。然而，在我们的模式中，穷人会更深入地参与进来，即使花费更少的时间，也会更疲劳。

 

Experiment 2 offers a more precise look at how scarcity changes engagement. Sixty-eight participants played a video game similar to Angry Birds. They fired shots from a slingshot, earning points for clearing targets. The poor had budgets of 30 shots (3 per level); the rich had 150 shots (15 per level). Some participants could not borrow shots, whereas others could borrow with R = 2 (essentially, 100% interest). Participants played until exhausting their budget.

实验2可以更准确地了解稀缺性如何改变参与度。 68名参与者玩了类似于愤怒的小鸟的视频游戏。 他们用弹弓射击，为清理目标赚取积分。 穷人的预算为30次（每级3次）; 富人有150次射击（每级15次）。 一些参与者不能借shots，而其他人可以借R = 2（基本上是100％的利息）。 参与者一直在玩，直到用尽预算。

 

To analyze how scarcity affected focus, we measured how long participants spent aim- ing each shot (i.e., how careful they were with their resources). Poor participants spent more time aiming the first shot of each level (log- transformed milliseconds, 8.08 T 0.42) than did rich participants (7.73 T 0.39) [F(1, 64) = 12.96, P < 0.001, hp2 = 0.17]. These results held for subsequent shots as well. Because the rich could always earn more points (and each additional point increased the chances of winning a prize), they had an incentive to remain engaged and use their resources well. Yet they were less en- gaged than the poor. Still, one might argue that these differences are driven by rich participants losing interest later in the game. However, these differences emerged on the very first shot of the game (poor: 8.19 T 0.52; rich: 7.86 T 0.52) [F(1, 64) = 6.58, P < 0.05].

为了分析稀缺性如何影响焦点，我们测量了参与者每次射击所花费的时间（即，他们对资源的谨慎程度）。 与富参与者（7.73 T 0.39）[F（1,64）= 12.96，P <0.001，hp2 = 0.17]相比，参与者花费更多时间瞄准每个级别的第一次射击（对数转换毫秒，8.08 T 0.42）。 这些结果也适用于后续拍摄。 因为富人总能获得更多积分（并且每增加一点就增加了获奖的机会），他们就有动力保持参与并充分利用他们的资源。 然而，他们的参与程度低于穷人。 尽管如此，有人可能会争辩说，这些差异是由富有的参与者在游戏后期失去兴趣所驱动的。 然而，这些差异出现在游戏的第一枪（差：8.19 T 0.52;富：7.86 T 0.52）[F（1,64）= 6.58，P <0.05]。

 

This engagement had some benefits for the poor. Among participants who could not borrow, the poor earned more points per shot (2.31 T 0.60) than did the rich (1.67 T 0.37) [F(1, 31) = 11.92, P < 0.005]. Rich participants had 5 times as many shots as the poor, but earned far fewer than 5 times as many points. If the rich had played as if they were poor, they would have performed better. It seems that to understand the psychology of scarcity, we must also appreciate the psychology of abundance. If scarcity can engage us too much, abundance might engage us too little.

这种参与对穷人有一些好处。 在无法借钱的参与者中，穷人每次射击得分（2.31 T 0.60）比富人（1.67 T 0.37）[F（1,31）= 11.92，P <0.005]。 富人的投篮次数是穷人投篮次数的5倍，但得分远不及5次。 如果富人的表现好像他们很穷，他们就会表现得更好。 似乎要理解稀缺的心理，我们也必须欣赏丰富的心理。 如果稀缺可能会让我们过多，那么丰富可能会让我们过少。

 

These results illustrate scarcity’s focusing effect. Field data also show scarcity-induced focus. For instance, instead of offering bulk discounts, some retailers raise the per-unit cost of an item as purchase quantity increases. Most people overlook these occasional “quantity surcharges,” but low-income consumers are more likely to notice these surcharges (30). Low-income consumers are also more sensitive to “hidden” taxes— those not included in the posted price (31).

这些结果说明了稀缺性的聚焦效应。 现场数据也显示出稀缺引起的焦点。 例如，一些零售商不是提供批量折扣，而是随着购买数量的增加而提高商品的单位成本。 大多数人忽略了偶尔的“数量附加费”，但低收入消费者更有可能注意到这些附加费（30）。 低收入消费者对“隐性”税收也更敏感 - 那些未包含在公布价格中的税收（31）。

 

To ensure that this was not an artifact of a particular context, we considered a different form of scarcity: having too little time. In experiment 3, 143 participants were given budgets of time with which to play Family Feud, a trivia game where each question allows multiple answers. Each round consisted of a new question and participants earned points for each correct answer. Poor participants had budgets of 300 s (15 per round); rich participants had 1000 s (50 per round). Participants played until exhausting their budget. There were three borrowing conditions: no borrowing, borrowing with R = 1 (i.e., “without interest”), and borrowing with R = 2 (“with interest”).

为了确保这不是特定背景的人工制品，我们考虑了一种不同的稀缺形式：时间太少。在实验3中，143名参与者被给予时间预算来玩Family Feud，这是一个琐事游戏，其中每个问题都允许多个答案。每轮都包含一个新问题，参与者为每个正确答案获得积分。参与者预算为300秒（每轮15个）;富有的参与者有1000秒（每轮50个）。参与者一直在玩，直到用尽预算。有三种借款条件：没有借款，借款R = 1（即“无利息”），借款R = 2（“有利息”）。

 






# Resource scarcity drives lethal aggression among prehistoric hunter-gatherers in central California

 

Results reveal that sharp force trauma, the most common form of violence in the record, is better predicted by resource scarcity than relative sociopolitical complexity. Blunt force cranial trauma shows no correlation with net primary productivity or political complexity and may reflect a different form of close contact violence. This study provides no support for the position that violence originated with the development of more complex hunter-gatherer adaptations in the fairly recent past. Instead, findings show that individuals are prone to violence in times and places of resource scarcity.

结果表明，资源稀缺性比相对社会政治复杂性更能预测有记录以来最常见的暴力形式——尖锐暴力创伤。钝力颅骨损伤与净初级生产力或政治复杂性无相关性，可能反映出不同形式的密切接触。这项研究不支持暴力起源于在最近的一段时间里更复杂的亨特-加特-埃勒适应的发展。相反，调查结果表明，在资源稀缺的时间和地点，个人容易发生暴力。

 

Current explanations for violence among hunter-gatherers focus on two hypotheses that emphasize the causal roles of either resource scarcity or political complexity.

目前关于狩猎采集者暴力行为的解释集中在两个假设上，强调资源稀缺或政治复杂性的因果作用。

 

The first hypothesis focuses on environmental variables, building on longstanding anthropological arguments about resource scarcity and competition (15, 16), but adding the central evolutionary tenant that violence should result from individual self-interest (17– 22). Given the obvious costs of engaging in aggression, including the risk of immediate mortality and long-term reprisals, individuals should only take up violence when the benefits (e.g., material goods, status, and long-term alliances) outweigh those costs (18–22).

第一个假设侧重于环境变量，建立在关于资源稀缺性和竞争的长期人类学论据的基础上（15，16），但添加了中心进化租户，即暴力应该由个人的自我利益造成（17-22）。考虑到参与侵略的明显成本，包括面临立即死亡和长期报复的风险，只有当利益（如物质产品、地位和长期联盟）超过这些成本（18-22）时，个人才应采取暴力行动。当环境生产率较低、资源稀缺、个人因盗窃而损失相对较大时（23），利益更可能超过成本。

 

The second hypothesis is sociopolitical and focuses on the group benefits of violence: even when the potential benefits of lethal aggression do not outweigh its physical cost (of injury or death), individuals may nevertheless risk their lives and join other unrelated individuals in violent conflict that benefits their sociopolitical group, if members who refuse to fight suffer significant costs of social punishment (24).

第二个假设是社会政治性的，侧重于暴力的群体利益：即使致命攻击的潜在利益不超过其身体成本（伤害或死亡），个人仍然可能冒着生命危险，与其他无关个人一起参与暴力冲突。这有利于他们的社会政治团体，如果拒绝战斗的成员遭受巨大的社会惩罚成本（24）。

 

In this hunter-gatherer case, environmental productivity is a stronger predictor of heightened levels of lethal aggression than relative sociopolitical complexity, supporting the notion that in contexts of resource scarcity, the perceived benefits for individuals to engage in lethal aggression may have outweighed the perceived costs. There are at least two ways to interpret this finding.

在这个狩猎-采集者的案例中，环境生产力比相对的社会政治复杂性更能预测致命性攻击的程度，支持这样一种观点：在资源稀缺的情况下，个体参与致命性攻击的感知利益是的，已经超过了预期的成本。

 

low environmental productivity could be associated with violence simply as a result of individuals experiencing more frequent resource shortfalls. When such events occur, and possibly even when they are anticipated, individuals may find it worthwhile to take resources or territories from their neighbors.

低环境生产率可能与暴力有关，这仅仅是由于个人经历了更频繁的资源短缺。当此类事件发生时，甚至可能在预期的情况下，个人可能会发现从其邻居那里获取资源或领土是值得的。

 

If such events are frequent enough, this could lead to increased levels of violence in low productivity regions. Individuals in low productivity environments may also be less tolerant of theft from neighbors. Given that the utility of a resource diminishes with the amount of that resource an individual possesses (23), those with more may be more tolerant of theft from others, whereas those with less should be less tolerant of theft.

如果此类事件频繁发生，可能会导致低生产力地区的暴力水平上升。在低生产率环境中的个人也可能对邻居的盗窃不太宽容。考虑到资源的效用随着个人拥有的资源量的减少而减少（23），那些拥有更多资源的人可能更能容忍他人的盗窃行为，而那些拥有较少资源的人则更不能够容忍盗窃行为。

 

The differences in violence between resource poor vs. rich environments may not result from differences in resource scarcity, but from how those resources are distributed resulting in changes in mobility and territory size. Populations in lower productivity environments have significantly larger territories (32) and greater mobility within those territories (34). Because individuals in low productivity environments must travel widely to obtain enough resources, individuals in these environments may operate in poorly defined territorial boundaries and may have less information about their neighbor’s willingness to punish poachers, both of which may cause individuals from neighboring groups to come into conflict. 

资源贫乏环境与资源丰富环境之间的暴力差异可能不是由于资源稀缺性的差异，而是由于这些资源的分布方式导致流动性和领土规模的变化。在生产力较低的环境中，人口的领土面积明显较大（32个），在这些地区的流动性较大（34个）。由于低生产力环境中的个人必须广泛旅行以获得足够的资源，因此这些环境中的个人可能在定义不明确的领土边界内活动，并且可能对其邻居惩罚偷猎者的意愿了解较少，这两种情况都可能导致来自邻近群体的个体发生冲突。

 

In this scenario, violence varies inversely with resource productivity as the result of disputes resulting from either conflicting territorial claims or misunderstandings and misinformation, where low population densities translate into widely separated groups unfamiliar with their neighbors and territorial boundaries. In these circumstances, individuals are making optimal assessments about how to acquire resources across a large and unproductive landscape on the basis of what little information they have regarding their neighbors, but this has the unintended consequence of increased violence.

在这种情况下，由于领土主张冲突或误解和误传导致的争端，暴力与资源生产率成反比，在这种情况下，低人口密度转化为不熟悉其邻居和环境的广泛分离的群体边界。在这种情况下，个人正在对如何在一个大的、没有生产力的环境中获取资源进行最佳评估，这是基于他们对邻居的信息很少，但这会导致暴力增加的意想不到的后果。

 

Regardless of which scenario underlies the negative correlation between projectile violence and environmental productivity, these results add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that rates of violence across small scale societies are driven by individual evaluations of costs and benefits. Rather than arguing whether or not violence is an ancestral or derived characteristic of human societies, we suggest that future work should continue to examine variation in the rates of violence across populations relative to indicators of resource scarcity to explain the underlying causes of violence throughout human history.

无论哪种情况是抛射暴力与环境生产力之间负相关的基础，这些结果都增加了越来越多的证据，表明小规模社会的暴力率是由成本和效益的个人评估驱动的。与其争论暴力是否是人类社会的祖先或起源特征，我们建议今后的工作应继续研究与资源稀缺指标相关的人口暴力率的变化，以解释暴力在整个人类历史中的根本原因。






# A Self-Regulatory Model of Resource Scarcity 

In it, we propose that consumers respond to resource scarcity through two distinct psychological pathways: a scarcity-reduction route aimed at reducing the discrepancy in resources and a control-restoration route aimed at reestablishing diminished personal control by attaining security in other domains. 

在这篇文章中，我们建议消费者通过两种不同的心理途径来应对资源短缺：一种减少资源短缺的途径，旨在减少资源差异；另一种控制恢复途径，旨在通过在其他领域获得安全感，重新建立减少的个人控制。

 

For example, resource scarcity has been shown to increase attention to scarcity-related concerns (Shah, Mullainathan, & Shafir, 2012) and prioritization of the scarce resource over other less relevant factors (Fernbach, Kan, & Lynch Jr., 2015; Shah, Shafir, & Mullainathan, 2015). 

例如，资源稀缺性已显示出增加了对稀缺性相关问题的关注（Shah、Mullainathan和Shafir，2012年），稀缺资源优先于其他不太相关的因素（Fernbach、Kan和Lynch Jr.，2015年；Shah、Shafir和Mullainathan，2015年）。

 

We categorize these responses to resource scarcity as efforts in service of scarcity-reduction. In this review, we posit that consumers who follow the scarcity-reduction route are motivated to acquire or consume the resource that is scarce (or will be scarce in the future). 

我们将这些对资源稀缺性的反应归类为服务于减少稀缺性的努力。在本文中，我们假设，遵循减少稀缺性路线的消费者有动机获得或消费稀缺（或未来稀缺）的资源。

 

In contrast, resource scarcity has also been shown to increase consumption of status or positional goods under conditions of economic hardship (Griskevicius et al., 2013; Walasek & Brown, 2015) and consumption of highly caloric foods (Briers & Laporte, 2013; Laran & Salerno, 2013; Levontin, Ein-Gar, & Lee, 2015). We categorize these responses to resource scarcity as efforts in service of control-restoration. 

相比之下，资源短缺也显示出在经济困难条件下增加地位或地位商品的消费（Griskevicius等人，2013年；Walasek&Brown，2015年）和高热量食品的消费（Briers&Laporte，2013年；Laran&Salerno，2013年；Levotin，Ein Gar）和Lee，2015年）。我们将这些对资源短缺的反应归类为为控制恢复服务的努力。

 

In this review, we suggest that consumers who follow the control-restoration route are motivated to bolster their diminished personal control by attaining security in domains outside of the resource scarcity.

在这篇评论中，我们建议那些遵循控制恢复路线的消费者，通过在资源稀缺之外的域中获得安全性来加强他们被削弱的个人控制。

 

We also predict when a consumer will respond to resource scarcity along the scarcity-reduction versus control-restoration pathway. Specifically, we contend that perceptions of the mutability of the resource discrepancy offer a parsimonious moderator for predicting when each route is pursued. 

我们还预测了消费者在减少资源短缺与控制恢复路径上对资源短缺的反应。具体来说，我们认为，对资源差异的可变性的感知为预测每条路线何时被采用提供了一个节俭的调节者。

 

Under conditions of high mutability, the consumer believes that he can reduce the resource discrepancy if he invests a reasonable amount of effort. Thus, he pursues scarcity-reduction. Under conditions of low mutability, the consumer believes that he cannot reduce the resource discrepancy if he invests a reasonable amount of effort, and thus pursues control-restoration. Because our model can help reconcile opposing self-regulatory consequences, we term our overarching theoretical perspective a self-regulatory model of resource scarcity.

在高易变性条件下，消费者认为只要投入合理的努力，就能减少资源差异。因此，他追求减少稀缺性。在易变性较低的情况下，消费者认为只要投入合理的努力，就不能减少资源差异，从而追求控制恢复。由于我们的模型有助于协调相反的自我监管后果，我们将我们的总体理论观点称为资源短缺的自我监管模型。

 

The definition and Measurement of Resource Scarcity

Agreement about the definition of resource scarcity does not presently exist in the literature (for a discussion, see Abrams, 1992). 

For example, Sharma and Alter (2012) defined financial deprivation, a form of resource scarcity, as “an unpleasant psycho- logical state in which consumers feel financially ‘inferior’ or ‘worse off’ relative to a salient comparison standard because they perceive a deficit in their financial resources” (p. 546). 

例如，Sharma和Alter（2012年）将资源稀缺的一种形式——财务剥夺定义为“一种令人不快的心理状态，在这种状态下，相对于显著的比较标准，消费者感到财务上“低劣”或“更差”，因为他们认为自己的财务存在赤字。

Mehta and Zhu (2016) defined resource scarcity as “the perceived supply level of physical resources that are required for an individual’s normal growth and maintenance” (p. 768). 

Mehta和Zhu（2016）将资源短缺定义为“个人正常增长和维持所需的物质资源的感知供应水平”（第768页）。

Griskevicius, Tybur, Delton, and Robertson (2011) drew upon Ellis, Figueredo, Brumbach, and Schlomer (2009) for their definition of resource scarcity as “the availability of energetic resources and level of competition for these resources” (p. 1016). 

Griskevicius、Tybur、Delton和Robertson（2011年）利用Ellis、Figueredo、Brumbach和Schlomer（2009年）将资源短缺定义为“能源资源的可用性和这些资源的竞争水平”（第1016页）。

Shah et al. (2012) discussed resource scarcity as a “mindset” that involves “having less” (p. 682). 

Shah等人（2012）讨论了资源稀缺作为一种“心态”，涉及“拥有更少”（第682页）。

In addition, Mullainathan and Shafir (2013) defined scarcity as “a subjective sense of having more needs than resources” (p. 86).

Mullainathan和Shafir（2013）将稀缺性定义为“拥有比资源更多需求的主观感觉”（第86页）。

 

Despite the different definitions of resource scarcity, one notable commonality is the existence of an unfavorable discrepancy in resource levels. 

尽管资源稀缺的定义不同，但一个显著的共性是资源水平存在不利差异。

Therefore, we propose that resource scarcity involves sensing or observing a discrepancy between one’s current level of resources and a higher, more desirable reference point. We define a resource as any quantifiable entity that offers utility to the individual and has the potential to be depleted or consumed (Abrams, 1992). 

因此，我们建议，资源稀缺涉及感知或观察一个人当前的资源水平与一个更高、更理想的参考点之间的差异。我们将资源定义为任何可量化的实体，它向个人提供效用，并有可能被耗尽或消耗。

Thus, scarcity can exist across many types of resources, including money (Fernbach et al., 2015; Nelson & Morrison, 2005; Sharma & Alter, 2012; Sharma, Mazar, Alter, & Ariely, 2014), food (Briers, Pandalaere, Dewitte, & Warlop, 2006; Petersen, Aarøe, Jensen, & Curry, 2014; Zhu & Ratner, 2015), products (Inman, Peter, & Raghubir, 1997; Worchel, Lee, & Adewole, 1975; Zhu & Ratner, 2015), and time (Fernbach et al., 2015; Shah et al., 2012).

稀缺性可能存在于多种资源中，包括货币、食品、产品和时间。

 

In the resource scarcity literature, many researchers have assumed that those with objectively or subjectively fewer resources are more likely to perceive a discrepancy between their resource levels and higher, more desirable reference points.

在资源稀缺性文献中，许多研究者假设，那些客观或主观上资源较少的人更容易察觉到他们的资源水平与更高、更可取的参考点之间的差异。

 

Accordingly, individual difference measures of one’s current resource levels are commonly employed as proxies for resource scarcity. These measurements can be categorized into two thematically distinct types.

因此，当前资源水平的个体差异测量通常被用作资源稀缺性的代表。这些测量可以分为两种不同的主题类型。

First, resource scarcity can be assessed by measuring individual-level resources, such as objective assessments of current income or wealth (Mani, Mullainathan, Shafir, & Zhao, 2013; Pitesa & Thau, 2014; Shah et al., 2015) or hunger (e.g., measured by time since last meal; Nelson & Morrison, 2005; Petersen et al., 2014; Shah et al., 2015).

首先，可以通过测量个人层面的资源来评估资源稀缺性，例如对当前收入或财富的客观评估或饥饿（例如，根据上次用餐后的时间来衡量）

Second, resource scarcity can be assessed by measuring macro-level resources, such as nation- and country-level poverty (Hill, Martin, & Chaplin, 2012; Martin & Hill, 2012) and unemployment rates (Hill, Rodeheffer, Griskevicius, Durante, & White, 2012).

其次，可以通过衡量宏观资源来评估资源稀缺性，例如国家和国家级的贫困和失业率。

​                                                  

   

 

**Resource scarcity has also been manipulated in prior research. We identified five thematically distinct types of manipulations that are commonly employed in the literature.**

First, resource scarcity can be manipulated by inducing individual-level scarcity, in which one’s personal resources are physically limited and/or thoughts about personal resource discrepancies are triggered. For example, researchers have restricted the number of guesses or points in an experimental game (Shah et al., 2012) or had participants write about what it would be like to grow up in a poor (vs. rich) family (Briers & Laporte, 2013; Mehta & Zhu, 2016).

首先，资源稀缺性可以通过诱发个人层面的稀缺性来控制，在这种稀缺性中，个人资源受到物理上的限制，引发对个人资源差异的思考。例如，研究人员限制了实验游戏中的猜测次数或点数，让参与者写下在贫穷家庭（与富裕家庭相比）成长的感受。

 

 Second, resource scarcity can be induced through social comparison, such as having participants compare themselves to better-off others (Sharma & Alter, 2012; Sharma et al., 2014). 

其次，资源稀缺性可以通过社会比较来诱导，例如让参与者将自己与富裕的其他人进行比较。

 

Third, resource scarcity can be induced by presenting participants with macro-level cues about resource scarcity in their environment, such as recessionary cues (Durante, Griskevicius, Redden, & Edward White, 2015; Hill, Rodeheffer, et al., 2012; White, Kenrick, Neel, & Neuberg, 2013). 

第三，资源稀缺性可以通过向参与者提供有关其环境中资源稀缺性的宏观线索来诱导，例如衰退线索

 

Fourth, resource scarcity can be manipulated by restricting product availability or through the use of other scarcity marketing tactics, including limited quantity appeals (Aggarwal, Jun, & Huh, 2011; Worchel et al., 1975) and time restric- tions (Brannon & Brock, 2001a; Inman et al., 1997). 

第四，可以通过限制产品可用性或使用其他稀缺性营销策略来控制资源稀缺性，包括数量有限的呼吁

 

Finally, the concept of resource scarcity can be primed through a variety of techniques including subliminally (Krosch & Amodio, 2014) or supralimi- nally exposing participants to scarcity-related words (Laran & Salerno, 2013; Rodeheffer, Hill, & Lord, 2012; Zhu & Ratner, 2015). 

最后，资源稀缺性的概念可以通过各种技术来启动，包括下意识地或超临界地让参与者接触稀缺性相关词

 

In the context of resource scarcity, we contend that when consumers observe an unfavorable discrepancy in resource levels, consumers will change their behavior to accommodate the discrepancy.

在资源稀缺的背景下，我们认为，当消费者发现资源水平存在不利差异时，他们会改变自己的行为以适应差异。

 

Problem-focused versus emotion-focused coping. Prior research supports the notion that people can respond to stress through problem-focused and/or emotion-focused coping. Because resource scarcity can also activate stress-related feelings (Griskevicius et al., 2013; Laran & Salerno, 2013), an alternative account is that our self-regulatory model is redundant with this existing perspective. For example, both problem-focused coping and scarcity-reduction directly resolve the source of the problem (e.g., acquire more scarce resources).

以问题为中心与以情绪为中心的应对。先前的研究支持这样一种观点，即人们可以通过以问题为中心和/或以情绪为中心的应对来应对压力。由于资源稀缺也会激活与压力相关的感觉（Griskevicius等人，2013年；Laran&Salerno，2013年），另一个解释是，我们的自我监管模式与现有观点是多余的。例如，以问题为中心的应对和减少短缺都直接解决了问题的根源（例如，获得更稀缺的资源）。

 

Importantly, however, the control-restoration route is distinct from emotion-focused coping in three notable ways. First, prior work has shown that threats that activate avoidance motivation rely on emotion-focused coping (Han, Duhachek, & Rucker, 2015). However, our review of the resource scarcity literature demonstrates that control-restoration involves numerous approach-oriented behaviors, such as approaching luxury goods (Griskevicius et al., 2013) and aggressive actions toward a vending machine (Kristofferson et al., 2017). This is further supported by evidence linking a lack of control with approach motivation (Greenaway et al., 2015).

然而，重要的是，控制恢复路径有三个显著的不同于以情绪为中心的应对方式。首先，先前的研究表明，激活回避动机的威胁依赖于以情绪为中心的应对（Han、Duhachek和Rucker，2015年）。然而，我们对资源稀缺性文献的回顾表明，控制恢复涉及许多面向方法的行为，例如接近奢侈品（Griskevicius等人，2013年）和对自动售货机采取积极行动（Kristofferson等人，2017年）。这进一步得到了证据的支持，证据表明缺乏控制与接近动机有关（Greenaway等人，2015年）。

 

Second, one assumption in the problem- and emotion-focused coping literature is that the processes are conscious and deliberative (Han, Duhachek, & Agrawal, 2015; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984). However, resource scarcity can be primed without conscious awareness (Krosch & Amodio, 2014; Laran & Salerno, 2013), and cognitive load manipulations have been shown not to affect the consequences of resource scarcity, suggesting that resource scarcity can influence behavior without deliberation (Briers & Laporte, 2013). Therefore, non-deliberative consequences of resource scarcity, such as creativity and categorizing, cannot be predicted by current theories of problem- and emotion-focused coping.

第二，在以问题和情绪为中心的应对中，一个假设是过程是有意识的和深思熟虑的。然而，资源稀缺性可以在没有意识意识的情况下被激发，认知负荷操作已被证明不会影响资源稀缺性的后果，这表明资源稀缺性可以在没有考虑的情况下影响行为。因此，当前的问题应对理论和以情感为中心的应对理论无法预测资源稀缺的非深思熟虑后果，如创造力和分类。

Third, as discussed, people often do not respond to resource scarcity by regulating discrete emotions or mood, but rather by restoring their sense of control through finding security in other domains. In our model, conscious emotions and negative affect may be consequences of low personal control, but they are not the central driver of the control-restoration route.

第三，正如所讨论的，人们通常不会通过调节离散的情绪或情绪来应对资源短缺，而是通过在其他领域寻找安全来恢复他们的控制感。在我们的模型中，有意识的情绪和负面影响可能是低个人控制的结果，但它们不是控制恢复路径的中心驱动力。

 






# Experimental scarcity increases the relative reinforcing value of food in food insecure adults 

It is possible that the experience of scarcity increases this reinforcing value. To date, no studies have examined this potential relationship experimentally in humans. The purpose of the studies presented here was to test the hypothesis that experimental manipulations of perceived scarcity would impact the relative reinforcing value of food.

 

One possible mechanism for this relationship is that a perception of scarce resources, such as during periods of food insecurity, may increase the relative reinforcing value (RRV) of food, which in turn leads to increased energy consumption (Epstein et al., 2007).

这种关系的一个可能机制是，对稀缺资源的感知，例如在粮食不安全时期，可能会增加粮食的相对强化值，进而导致能源消耗增加。

 

Shah, Mullainathan, and Shafir (2012) hypothesized that a mindset of scarcity, or a perception of having less than one needs, creates an attentional bias for the scarce resource to the detriment of other needs. This attentional bias, or scarcity mindset, may extend to any type of resource, including money, time, and food. Further, this attentional bias makes it extremely difficult to focus on other pressing needs (Shah, Mullainathan, & Shafir, 2012).

Shah、Mullainathan和Shafir（2012年）假设，稀缺性的心态或对需求少于一种的感知会对稀缺资源造成注意力偏差，从而损害其他需求。这种注意力偏差，或稀缺的心态，可能扩展到任何类型的资源，包括金钱、时间和食物。此外，这种注意力偏差使得人们很难将注意力集中在其他紧迫的需求上.

 

**Scarcity Manipulation:** In order to manipulate perceptions of scarcity, we inserted a script after the second food reinforcer was earned. 

**In the control condition**, the experimenter entered the room and asked if the computer monitors were working properly. 

**In the “resource- limited” condition**, the participants were told that the laboratory was running low on the food that they were working for, but that they should continue to work for as much as they wanted and would be informed if we ran out. In reality, no limits were placed on the amount the participant could earn. 

**In the “time-limited” condition**, participants were told that due to scheduling difficulties, we would have to end the task in five-minutes, but that they should continue to work for food and/or reading if they wished. This time limit was placed on the task so that the participants did not become suspicious for later appointments.

 

Overall, the current two studies suggest that experiences of scarcity may have an effect on the RRV of food. Across two studies, our results show an increase in the RRV of food under conditions of experimental scarcity only among participants already suffering from food insecurity. We posit that those suffering from true scarcity in their daily lives are far more sensitive to manipulations meant to prime a scarcity mindset. Much research is still needed to fully gauge the scale and scope of the effects of scarcity on eating behavior and motivation. Future research should replicate and extend these findings with larger sample sizes, stratified by socioeconomic status. Additionally, little is known about the effects of scarcity on the RRV of food among developing youth, who may be more sensitive to these effects when reinforcer pathways are still solidifying in the brain.

总的来说，目前的两项研究表明，缺乏经验可能会对食物的RRV产生影响。在两项研究中，我们的研究结果显示，只有在食品不安全的参与者中，实验性稀缺条件下，食品的RRV才会增加。我们假设，那些在日常生活中遭受真正稀缺的人对那些旨在激发稀缺心态的操纵更加敏感。目前还需要进行大量的研究，以全面衡量稀缺性对饮食行为和动机影响的规模和范围。未来的研究应该复制和扩展这些发现，以更大的样本量，按社会经济地位分层。此外，对于缺乏对发育中青年食物RRV的影响知之甚少，当增强剂途径仍在大脑中凝固时，他们可能对这些影响更为敏感。






# Scarcity Polarizes Preferences: The Impact on Choice Among Multiple Items in a Product Class 

 

The authors propose that overall perception of scarcity versus overall perception of abundance increases choice share of the most-preferred item from a product class. They argue that this phenomenon occurs because scarcity induces arousal and the heightened arousal polarizes the evaluations of individual items contained in the choice set. The results from five experiments show that scarcity versus abundance broadens the discrepancy between the liking of the favorite and nonfavorite items and leads to a greater choice share of the favorite item. The findings provide support for the arousal-based explanation, showing that the effect of scarcity salience on choices is mediated by consumers’ reported arousal level and moderated by an experimentally induced arousal state.

作者提出，对稀缺性的总体认知与对丰度的总体认知会增加产品类别中最受欢迎产品的选择份额。他们认为，这种现象的发生是因为稀缺性导致了觉醒，而增强的觉醒使对选择集中所包含的个别项目的评估两极分化。五个实验的结果表明，稀缺性和丰度扩大了喜爱和非喜爱物品之间的差异，并导致更大的喜爱物品的选择份额。这些发现为基于唤醒的解释提供了支持，表明稀缺性显著性对选择的影响是由消费者报告的唤醒水平介导的，并由实验诱导的唤醒状态调节。

 

Scarcity enhances perceived value and demand of products that are useful, conveyable, and potentially possessable (Brock, 1986; Gier & Huettl, 2010; Sevilla & Redden, 2014). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the attractiveness of a scarce item, including psychological reactance, need for uniqueness, and heuristic inferences of value based on availability.

稀缺性增强了产品的感知价值和需求，这些产品是有用的、可传递的，并且可能是可能的。提出了几种解释稀缺物品吸引力的机制，包括心理对抗、独特性需求和基于可用性的启发式价值推论。

 

More recently, consumer researchers have expanded the scope beyond object-specific scarcity to general perception of resource scarcity, exploring situationally activated scarcity (Laran & Salerno, 2012; Shah et al., 2012) and individual differences in deprivation history (Griskevicius et al., 2013).

Activating the perception of having too little prompts a tendency to focus on problems for which resource inadequacy is salient, creating attentional neglects in other domains and resulting in excessive borrowing (Shah et al., 2012)

 

Prior research has theorized about a possible connection between scarcity and arousal (Cialdini, 2009). As Cialdini (2009, p. 267) explains, when something that people like is less available, they become physically agitated, such that their focus narrows, emotions rise, and cognitive processes are often suppressed by “brain-clouding arousal”.

 

The findings indicate that the salience of scarcity does not boost the attractiveness of all items to the same degree. Rather, scarcity increases the attractiveness of the a priori most-preferred item but decreases the attractiveness of the less-preferred items, leading consumers to choose more of the favorite item.

 

The finding that the effects of category-level scarcity on choices extends to the manipulation of a general sense of scarcity confirms the emerging view that the connection between perception of scarcity and consumer judgement and decision making is context independent.

The present study provide evidence that scarcity serves as one antecedent of arousal.

 

Scarcity induced arousal leads to more polarized assessments of consumer goods and influences the choices consumers make when choosing among multiple items in a product class.

 

 






# Creating When You Have Less: The Impact of Resource Scarcity on Product Use Creativity

Another part of the research on scarcity, and more relevant to the current work, has examined how scarcity shapes consumers’ cognitive orientation and decision making (Chaturvedi, Chiu, and Viswanathan 2009; Shah et al. 2012). In particular, this research shows that scarcity affects consumer behavior within a given consumption context by activating a cognitive orientation focused on the constraints. For example, Folkes, Martin, and Gupta (1993) find that scarce versus abundant supply quantity of a product led consumers to focus on this constraint (i.e., diminished supply), which consequently decreased the usage amount of the product. Along a similar line of reasoning, Shah et al. (2012) show that participants assigned a scarce versus abundant budget in a multiple-round game were engaged in addressing the demands of each current round, that is, focusing on the constraints while failing to consider what would come in the future rounds (i.e., neglecting problems unrelated to the presented constraints), which resulted in excessive borrowing.

稀缺性研究的另一部分研究了稀缺性如何影响消费者的认知取向和决策。这项研究表明，稀缺性通过激活关注约束的认知取向，影响特定消费环境下的消费者行为。例如，Folkes、Martin和Gupta（1993）发现，一种产品的稀缺与充足供应量导致消费者关注这一限制（即供应减少），从而减少了产品的使用量。Shah等（2012）表明，在多轮博弈中，分配了稀缺预算与充裕预算的参与者致力于解决当前每轮的需求，即，关注约束，而不考虑未来几轮的需求，导致过度借贷。

 

Based on the distinct streams of research just cited, we expect that the salience of resource scarcity will activate a constraint mindset (i.e., a general cognitive orientation focused on the existence of constraints), which can persist and affect consumer decision making in a subsequent, independent consumption context.

基于刚刚引用的不同研究流，我们预计资源稀缺的显著性将激活一种约束心态（即，集中于约束存在的一般认知取向），它可以在随后的独立的过程中持续并影响消费者决策。

 

The finding that a general sense of scarcity activated in a prior context can affect product use creativity in subsequent, unrelated consumption environments supports the emerging view that there is a context-independent connection between perception of scarcity and consumer judgment and decision making (Griskevicius et al. 2011; Laran and Salerno 2013; Shah et al. 2012; Zhu and Ratner 2015).

在先前环境中激活的一般稀缺感会影响随后的、无关的消费环境中的产品使用创造力，这一发现支持了一种新的观点，即稀缺感与消费者判断和决策之间存在一种与环境无关的联系。






# Reducing debt improves psychological functioning and changes decision-making in the poor 

The demands of daily life under scarcity create “bandwidth taxes” that sap mental resources, impairing cognitive ability and causing counterproductive behavior which perpetuates poverty (1–3).

稀缺性下的日常生活需求产生了“带宽税”，消耗了心理资源，削弱了认知能力，并导致了反生产行为，使贫困持续下去。

\3. Haushofer J, Fehr E (2014) On the psychology of poverty. Science 344:862–867.

 

The impact of debt on the poor is psychological, not just financial. Debt causes significant psychological and cognitive impairment and alters decision-making. However, debt has these effects not just because of the economic costs of holding debt, but because debt mental accounting creates bandwidth taxes that impair cognitive processes. Understanding this pathway motivates new approaches to poverty policy. As an illustration, consider two possible housing policies to improve the cognitive functioning of low-income tenants who fall behind on their bills. A policy that considers mental-accounting costs would combine bills for rent, power, water, and maintenance into one statement instead of billing tenants separately. But a policy which ignores mental-accounting costs might simply apply automatic payments, send tenants reminders, or coordinate billing on the same repayment schedule (46). Our study suggests that policies which consider mental-accounting costs may be more effective.

债务对穷人的影响是心理上的，而不仅仅是经济上的。债务导致严重的心理和认知障碍，并改变决策。然而，债务具有这些影响，不仅是因为持有债务的经济成本，而且因为债务心理会计产生的带宽税损害了认知过程。了解这一途径可以推动贫困政策的新方法。举例来说，考虑两种可能的住房政策，以改善落后于账单的低收入租户的认知功能。一项考虑心理会计成本的政策将把租金、电费、水费和维修费合并成一份报表，而不是单独向租户计费。但是，一项忽略了心理会计成本的政策可能只是简单地应用自动支付、发送租户提醒或协调同一还款计划的账单（46）。我们的研究表明，考虑心理会计成本的政策可能更有效。

The second is to critically evaluate the bandwidth tax trade-offs of policies that encourage people to narrowly bracket decisions as mental accounts to shape behavior. These include commitment devices such as child-education accounts or job-performance targets in the task economy. When people have resources, mental accounting may help motivate people to overcome their self-control problems and achieve outcomes that are genuinely welfare enhancing. But in tandem with poverty, or any other deficit of resources, encouraging excessive mental accounting, particularly when loss frames are evoked, imposes psychological costs that may far outweigh other benefits.

第二个问题是批判性地评估政策的带宽税权衡，这些政策鼓励人们狭隘地将决策划分为心理账户来塑造行为。这些包括如儿童教育账户或任务经济中的工作绩效指标。当人们拥有资源时，心理会计可以帮助人们克服自我控制问题，取得真正提高福利的成果。但是，与贫困或其他任何资源不足同时，鼓励过度的心理核算，特别是当损失框架被唤起时，会产生远远超过其他益处的心理成本。






# Effects of social popularity and time scarcity on online consumer behaviour regarding smart healthcare products: An eye-tracking approach 

Human decision-making behaviors are influenced by situational and environment conditions such as time, money, and information (Shin & Biocca, 2017). In an online marketplace environment, vendors persuade people to buyer products with claims such as the exact amount of time may therefore significantly compel consumer to order a product online; this is because the belief that “time is money” may lead consumers to seize an otherwise unavailable opportunity (Godinho, Prada, & Vaz Garrido, 2016). Further, researchers have also examined potential pressure situations such as time scarcity as an environmental signal in an online marketplace (e.g., Amirpur & Benlian, 2015), and consumers' purchase behavior is also influenced by social and contextual information accumulated online (Yi, Jiang, & Zhou, 2014). 

人类决策行为受环境和环境条件的影响。在一个在线市场环境中，供应商说服人们购买带有索赔的产品，例如准确的时间量，因此可能会极大地迫使消费者在线订购产品；这是因为“时间就是金钱”的信念可能会导致消费者抓住其他不可用的产品。此外，研究人员还研究了潜在的压力情况，如时间短缺，作为在线市场的环境信号消费者的购买行为也受到在线积累的社会和背景信息的影响。

 

Aggarwal, Jun, and Huh (2011) stated that scarcity enhances the perceived value of a product and leads to higher product desirability and an increased willingness to purchase. Moreover, Suri, Kohli, and Monroe (2007) argued that the presence of scarcity in messages enhances consumers' cognitive perceptions and play an important role in consumers' decision-making, such as the choice of a product or service (Mittone & Savadori, 2009).

稀缺性提高了产品的感知价值，并导致更高的产品需求和购买意愿。此外，Suri、Kohli和Monroe（2007）认为，信息的稀缺性增强了消费者的认知感知，并在消费者的决策中起到重要作用，例如选择产品或服务。

 

In e-commerce research, time scarcity is also known as “time pressure” (e.g., Chang & Chen, 2015). Especially in the context of online auctions, the auctioneer normally imposes a deadline such as “time-left-to-buy” as the time scarcity element. Time constraint may increase the level of arousal and psychological stress, as well as change human behavior (Rau, Zhou, Chen, & Lu, 2014). Therefore, time scarcity has been studied in marketing, where literature suggests that time pressure influences consumers' behavior and decision-making (Thomas, Esper, & Stank, 2010).

在电子商务研究中，时间稀缺性也被称为“时间压力”。特别是在网上拍卖的情况下，拍卖人通常会将诸如“剩余购买时间”之类的最后期限作为时间稀缺因素。时间限制可能会增加唤醒和心理压力的水平，并改变人类行为。因此，在市场营销中研究了时间稀缺性，文献表明时间压力影响消费者的行为和决策。

 

Two theories are of particular relevance in relation to scarcity: commodity theory and reactance theory (Anh, 2014; Gupta, 2013, p. 41). Commodity theory states that the greater the restricted availability and uniqueness of a product, the greater the value it will be given (Anh, 2014). Reactance theory suggests that if an individual's freedom is threatened or eliminated, s/he experiences psychological reactance, which is a motivational state directed toward to safeguard a person's behavioral freedom (Gupta, 2013, p. 41). Thus, a limited or unavailable product implies a threat to personal freedom, which may trigger psychological reactance and lead to greater attention to the product.

两种理论与稀缺性有着特殊的相关性：商品理论和电抗理论。商品理论指出，产品受限制的可用性和唯一性越大，其价值就越大。反抗理论表明，如果一个人的自由受到威胁或被消除，他/她会经历心理反抗，这是一种旨在保护一个人行为自由的激励状态。因此，有限或不可用的产品意味着对人身自由的威胁，这可能引发心理上的反抗，并导致对产品的更多关注。

 

Scarcity has been categorized into limited-time and limited-quantity scarcity in the marketplace (Aggarwal et al., 2011; Gierl, Plantsch, & Schweidler, 2008). Limited-time scarcity refers to a situation in which an item listed on a website is only available for a certain period of time, and the offer becomes unavailable after the deadline (Gierl et al., 2008; Gupta, 2013, p. 41). In an online marketplace, when consumers are given less time on a decision, they are not likely to process all the information; rather, they make their decisions according to a restricted set of attributes and are less likely to defer a purchase decision (Godinho et al., 2016). Limited-quantity scarcity refers to a situation in which an item is only available in a specific quantity; thus, once the item has sold out, the offer is unavailable (Gierl et al., 2008; Gupta, 2013, p. 41). The same behavioral pattern observed in limited-time scarcity situations applies similarly in these limited-quantity scarcity situations.

稀缺性被分为有限时间和有限数量的市场稀缺性。有限时间稀缺是指网站上列出的某个项目仅在一段时间内可用，并且在截止日期后无法提供的情况。在在线市场中，当消费者获得的决策时间较少时，他们不太可能处理所有信息；相反，他们根据一组受限制的属性做出决策，也不太可能推迟购买决策。有限数量稀缺指的是一个项目只能以特定数量提供；因此，一旦该项目售完，就无法提供报价。在有限时间稀缺情况下观察到的相同行为模式同样适用于这些有限数量稀缺情况。

 

If there is limited time to buy a product from an auction website, consumers normally think that the product has higher value and better quality, and they would therefore be more motivated to own the product. Consequently, this leads to greater attention for the product. Prior empirical evidence suggests that time scarcity influences individuals' perceptions, such as risk perceptions (Amirpur & Benlian, 2015). Further, Guo, Xin, and Wu (2017) found that limited-time scarcity messages can significantly influence online consumers’ arousal toward impulsive purchase in online shopping settings. However, time scarcity does not serve as a signal for trust. When consumers have limited time to shop online for a product, their first consideration may be to rush to buy it. They have little time to evaluate the product and determine whether they trust it.

如果从拍卖网站购买产品的时间有限，消费者通常认为该产品具有更高的价值和更好的质量，因此他们更有动力拥有该产品。因此，这会引起对产品的更多关注。先前的经验证据表明，时间短缺会影响个人的感知，例如风险感知。此外，Guo、Xin和Wu（2017）发现，有限的时间稀缺性信息会显著影响在线消费者在网上购物环境中冲动购买的冲动。然而，时间短缺并不能作为信任的信号。当消费者在网上购物的时间有限时，他们的首要考虑可能是急于购买产品。他们几乎没有时间评估产品并确定是否信任它。

 

Limited time scarcity plays an important role in the online marketplace with regard to consumers’ visual attention. When there is a limited time to purchase a product online, it is more likely that the product will attract greater attention.

有限时间的稀缺性在消费者视觉关注的网络市场中起着重要作用。当网上购买产品的时间有限时，产品更有可能吸引更多的关注。

 

This study found that time scarcity significantly influences consumers' perceptions. As a result, if online marketplace practitioners add the function of “time-left-to-buy” to their websites, this can increase consumers’ value and product quality perceptions.


# How Scarcity Frames Value 

We suggest that under scarcity, pressing needs capture attention (Shah, Mullainathan, Sha r, 2012). As a result, things like a utility bill or rent payment or other needs are often top-of-mind. These thoughts make tradeoffs very accessible—buying one thing means giving up another. These tradeoffs provide an internal frame of reference that more steadily guides our perception of value. As a result, valuations under scarcity are less subject to irrelevant contextual features and are instead based on these consistent, accessible tradeoffs. Across six studies, we show that scarcity makes tradeoffs more accessible and therefore makes valuation more consistent. This seems true for monetary scarcity, caloric scarcity, and experimentally induced time scarcity.

稀缺导致个体关注需要，诸如水电费账单、租金支付或其他需求等事情往往是最重要的。这些想法使得权衡变得非常容易。买一件事就意味着放弃另一件事。这些权衡提供了一个内部参考框架，可以更稳定地指导我们对价值的感知。因此，稀缺性下的估值不太受不相关的上下文特征的影响，而是基于这些一致的、可获取的权衡。在六项研究中，我们发现，稀缺性使得权衡更容易获得，从而使估值更一致。货币稀缺性、热量稀缺性和实验性诱导的时间稀缺性似乎都是如此。

 

In Study 1a (N=103), participants saw a classic scenario where they named their willingness to pay for a beer that was either purchased from a convenience store or a fancy hotel (Thaler, 1985). Participants typically offer a higher price for the beer from the hotel than convenience store because the contexts have different reference prices. In this study, participants were simply asked to describe what they would think about as they came up with their willingness-to-pay. Wealthier participants were more likely to say that they would think about where the beer was being purchased (i.e., context). Poorer participants were more likely to say that they would think about items they could not buy if they bought the beer (i.e., tradeoffs). In Study 1b (N=151) participants named their willingness-to-pay. Wealthier participants replicated the classic effect, offering a higher price for the beer from the hotel. But poorer participants were less swayed by this feature of the context, instead naming prices that were nearly equivalent across both frames. In Studies 1c and 1d we replicated these results on a larger sample from the same population (N=604) and on a large, nationally representative sample (N=2015).

在研究1a中，参与者看到了一个经典的场景，在这个场景中，他们说出自己更愿意从便利店还是高档酒店购买的啤酒买单。因为情境中的参考价格，参与者花更高的价格购买高档酒店的啤酒，更低的价格购买便利店的酒。在这项研究中，参与者被简单地要求描述当他们提出他们的支付意愿时他们会想到什么。更富有的参与者更可能会说他们会考虑在哪里购买啤酒（即上下文）。穷人参与者更可能会说，如果他们买了啤酒，他们会考虑他们买不到的东西（例如，折衷）。在研究1b（n=151）中，参与者说出了他们的支付意愿。富有的参与者复制了经典效应，为酒店提供了更高的啤酒价格。但较差的参与者对这一背景特征的影响较小，而不是说出两帧中几乎相等的价格。在研究1c和1d中，我们将这些结果复制到来自同一人群（n=604）的较大样本和具有全国代表性的较大样本（n=2015）上。

 

In Study 2a (N=705), we tested a classic demonstration of “proportional thinking” (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981). Participants indicated whether they would be willing to travel 30 minutes to save $50 on a tablet computer. The tablet was priced at $300, $500, or $1000. People are usually more willing to travel for the discount when the tablet is cheaper (i.e., a higher proportional discount). That is, to get a sense of whether $50 is worth 30 minutes, people look to the total cost. But we expected that poorer participants would value the discount more consistently. Indeed, higher-income participants were more willing to travel when the discount was proportionally larger, but lower-income participants were less sensitive to the proportional size of the discount. In Study 2b, we directly replicated these results on the nationally representative sample from Study 1d.

在研究2a（n=705）中，我们测试了“比例思维”的经典演示（Tversky和Kahneman，1981）。参与者表示，他们是否愿意花30分钟的时间在平板电脑上节省50美元。这款平板电脑的价格是300美元、500美元或1000美元。人们通常更愿意在平板电脑更便宜（即比例更高的折扣）的情况下为折扣旅行。也就是说，为了了解50美元是否值30分钟，人们会考虑总成本。但我们预计，较贫穷的参与者会更一贯地重视折扣。事实上，当折扣比例较大时，收入较高的参与者更愿意出行，但收入较低的参与者对折扣比例大小的敏感度较低。在研究2b中，我们直接将这些结果复制到研究1d中具有全国代表性的样本上。

 

In Study 3 (N = 505), participants rated the attractiveness of one of two lotteries. One lottery simply offered a chance to win $9 (otherwise nothing). Another lottery offered the same chance of winning $9 (otherwise lose 25 cents). People typically rate the latter lottery as more attractive (even though it is dominated) because the small loss makes it easier to evaluate the worth of $9 (Slovic et al., 2002). Here, this effect holds for the rich, but not for the poor. Again, the poor have a more stable representation of value. In Study 4 (N=263), participants considered small accounts (i.e., cash in their wallet) or large accounts (i.e., money in the bank) and then rated the expensiveness of a consumer product. Typically, participants rate the product as less expensive if they have been primed to think of the large account (Morewedge et al., 2007). This again holds for wealthier participants, but not poorer participants.

在研究3（n=505）中，参与者评价了两个彩票中的一个的吸引力。一次抽奖只提供了赢得9美元的机会（否则什么也没有）。另一个彩票提供了同样的机会赢得9美元（否则损失25美分）。人们通常认为后一种彩票更具吸引力（即使它是占主导地位的），因为小损失使评估9美元的价值更容易（Slovic等人，2002年）。在这里，这种效应适用于富人，但不适用于穷人。同样，穷人的价值表现更为稳定。在研究4（n=263）中，参与者考虑小账户（即钱包里的现金）或大账户（即银行里的钱），然后对消费品的价格进行评级。通常，如果参与者已经准备好考虑大客户，他们会认为该产品价格更低（Morewedge等人，2007年）。这同样适用于较富有的参与者，但不适用于较贫穷的参与者。

 

We conceptually replicated these results with different forms of scarcity in Studies 5 and 6. In Study 5 (N=234), dieters (those experiencing caloric scarcity) and non-dieters considered small or large caloric accounts (how many calories they consume in a day or a week) and then judged how fattening a large order of French fries felt. Non-dieters judged the fries to be less fattening when primed with a large account, but dieters provided more consistent evaluations across contexts. Finally, in Study 6 (N=74), we manipulated time scarcity (as in Shah et al., 2012). Participants played a game in which they were given a small time-budget (poor participants) or a large one (rich participants). Afterward, they were primed to think of a small account (time per round) or a large account (time for the whole game). Then, they were asked to imagine losing 10 seconds from a round of the game and to rate how costly that loss would feel. Time-rich participants rated the loss as less costly when primed with the large account, but time-poor participants provided more consistent evaluations across contexts.

我们在研究5和6中以不同形式的稀缺性概念上复制了这些结果。在研究5（n=234）中，节食者（那些热量缺乏的人）和非节食者考虑了少量或大量的热量账户（他们一天或一周内消耗了多少卡路里），然后判断了大量薯条的脂肪含量。非节食者在大量食用薯条时，认为薯条不容易发胖，但节食者在不同环境下提供了更一致的评价。最后，在研究6（n=74）中，我们操纵了时间稀缺性（如Shah等人，2012）。参加者玩的游戏中，他们得到了一个小的时间预算（可怜的参加者）或一个大的（富有的参加者）。之后，他们开始考虑一个小账户（每轮时间）或一个大账户（整个游戏的时间）。然后，他们被要求想象在一轮比赛中输了10秒，并评估这种损失的代价。时间丰富的参与者在准备大客户时将损失评估为较低的成本，但时间贫乏的参与者提供了跨上下文更一致的评估。

 

Taken together, these studies suggest that scarcity indeed frames problems in a more stable way. These studies have the promise to resolve lingering questions in psychology and economics. Economics makes many predictions about how preferences should unfold, while behavioral science has identified several ways in which those predictions break down. But economics makes those predictions because it assumes that people regularly recognize scarcity in the world and consider the tradeoffs that it imposes. But when we experience slack, those tradeoffs recede from attention, and we can only look to the environment for guidance on what things are worth. However, it may be the case that when scarcity becomes a psychological reality, we create a context which we carry with us and which more steadily frames our perspective.

综上所述，这些研究表明，稀缺性确实以一种更稳定的方式来界定问题。这些研究有希望解决心理学和经济学中挥之不去的问题。经济学对偏好应该如何展开做出了许多预测，而行为科学已经确定了这些预测分解的几种方式。但是经济学做出这些预测是因为它假定人们经常认识到世界上的稀缺性，并考虑到它所带来的权衡。但是，当我们经历松弛时，这些权衡就从注意力中消失了，我们只能从环境中寻找关于事物价值的指导。然而，可能是这样的，当稀缺成为一个心理现实时，我们创造了一个环境，我们随身携带，它更稳定地框架我们的观点。

 






# You Can’t Always Get What You Want: The Effect of Childhood Scarcity on Substitution Decisions 

One issue all consumers occasionally face is choosing a replacement for an alternative that becomes unavailable, is too expensive or is restricted in some other way (Hamilton et al. 2014). Moreover, consumers with fewer resources may be forced to forgo desired alternatives more frequently than those with more resources. Thus, consumers with fewer resources may get more practice making substitutions than consumers with more resources, potentially changing their cognitive and emotional responses when access to desired alternatives is restricted. This could be considered adaptive if the cognitive and emotional responses of low childhood SES consumers make the substitution process easier. Consistent with this idea, research on life history strategy shows that experiencing scarcity during childhood can have a lasting effect on consumer decision making. For example, research has shown that perceived childhood socioeconomic status (SES) influences risk-taking and temporal discounting in response to cues about economic uncertainty (Griskevicius et al. 2013). Although seeing images of recession made high childhood SES participants more willing to delay rewards, the same cues made low childhood SES participants less willing to delay rewards (i.e., more impatient; Griskevicius et al. 2013).

所有消费者偶尔会面临的一个问题是，为一个无法获得、过于昂贵或以其他方式受到限制的替代品选择重新安置。更重要的是，资源较少的消费者可能会比资源较多的消费者更频繁地被迫放弃所需的替代品。因此，与资源丰富的消费者相比，资源较少的消费者可能会获得更多的实践，当接触到所需的改变者受到限制时，可能会改变他们的认知和情感反应。如果低儿童SES消费者的认知和情绪反应使替代过程更容易，则认为这是适应性的。与此相一致的是，对生命史策略的研究表明，儿童时期经历的稀缺性对消费者决策具有持久的影响。例如，研究表明，儿童社会经济地位（SES）对经济不确定性提示的风险承担和时间贴现的影响（Griskevicius等人2013年）。尽管看到经济衰退的图像使高童年的SES参与者更愿意延迟奖励，但同样的线索使低童年的SES参与者更不愿意延迟奖励（即，更不耐烦；Griskevicius等人2013）。

 

In our research, we examine the effects of perceived childhood SES on substitution behavior. Although previous research suggests that experiencing childhood scarcity can make consumers more impulsive, we predict that when making substitution decisions, consumers with low childhood SES will exhibit more patience than those with high childhood SES. Specifically, due to their more extensive practice with not getting what they want, consumers with low childhood SES may have learned cognitive and emotional response strategies that make them better at regulating the negative emotions arising from these experiences, and therefore more willing to accept delays in getting a chosen item.

在我们的研究中，我们研究了感知儿童SES对替代行为的影响。尽管之前的研究表明，经历儿童期缺乏会使消费者更加冲动，但我们预测，在做出替代决策时，儿童期低SES的消费者比儿童期高SES的消费者表现出更多的耐心。具体来说，由于他们在没有得到他们想要的东西的情况下进行了更广泛的实践，儿童期SES较低的消费者可能已经学习了认知和情绪反应策略，使他们能够更好地调节这些经历产生的负面情绪，因此更愿意接受获取所选项目的延迟。

 

To better understand the process by which consumers experience substitution, we examine consumers’ valuations of chosen items over time. Earlier research shows that low SES consumers exhibit a weaker cognitive dissonance reaction than high SES consumers do, and that their valuations of chosen and non-chosen alternatives do not diverge as much after choice as those of high SES consumers (Snibbe and Markus 2005). One possibility, then, is that low childhood SES consumers will devalue their chosen alternative less than high childhood SES consumers when it becomes unavailable. Another possibility, however, is that given their more extensive practice making substitutions, low childhood SES consumers will devalue their chosen alternative more when it becomes unavailable, making it easier for them to select a replacement.

 

We test these predictions in a series of studies using choices in two different product categories. In the  first study, 256 MTurk participants were given information about three movies they could download. After rating all three movies, they chose one movie to download. After choosing their movie, participants were told that unfortunately, due to technical difficulties, the movie they had chosen was unavailable. They answered several questions about how they felt and then were asked how long they would be willing to wait for their chosen movie to become available. If they chose not to wait, participants could select a replacement from among the remaining two movies. Participants then answered questions about their perceived childhood and current SES using items from Griskevicius et al. (2013). Qualifying earlier research demonstrating that high childhood SES consumers are often more willing to delay rewards, high childhood SES Ps expressed less willingness to wait for their chosen movie than low childhood SES Ps, even though there were no differences in initial evaluations of the movies across groups.

 

In the second study, 485 student participants read a description of four different articles, rated the articles and then chose one of the articles for a task in which they tagged keywords. After choosing their article, all participants were told that unfortunately, the quota for the article they had selected had already been filled. Half of the participants chose among the other three articles and the other half were assigned one of the three other articles for the task. Participants answered questions about they felt, rated their chosen article again and then answered questions about their childhood and current SES (Griskevicius et al. 2013). When they were told that their chosen article was unavailable, low childhood SES Ps responded by devaluing their chosen article significantly more relative to their initial ratings than high childhood SES Ps. Notably, the devaluation effect was stronger when low childhood SES Ps chose a replacement than when they were assigned a replacement, suggesting that the devaluation was motivated by a desire to make the choice process easier.

In summary, these results suggest that consumers with low perceived childhood SES may have developed strategies to make it easier to cope with more frequent restrictions on the availability of desired alternatives. We find that consumers with low (vs. high) childhood SES are more willing to wait for an initially chosen alternative but are more likely to devalue it when it becomes unavailable, making it easier to choose a substitute. In our planned follow-up studies, we will examine the cognitive and emotional responses that lead to these outcomes.

总之，这些结果表明，儿童SES认知水平较低的消费者可能已经制定了一些策略，使其更容易应对对所需替代品可用性更频繁的限制。我们发现，儿童SES较低（与较高）的消费者更愿意等待最初选择的替代品，但当它变得不可用时，更有可能使其贬值，从而更容易选择替代品。在我们计划的后续研究中，我们将研究导致这些结果的认知和情感反应。

 






# Effects of Resource Scarcity on Perceptions of Control and Impulsivity 

We hypothesize and provide evidence that resource scarcity leads individuals from relatively poorer childhood backgrounds to feel that they have less personal control. Consequently, this psychological sense of decreased control facilitates preference for smaller sooner rewards.

 

In Study 1, we examined our basic prediction that resource scarcity produces different effects on people’s control beliefs depending on their childhood backgrounds and not their current economic conditions. We experimentally manipulated scarcity by having participants view a series of photos successfully used in previous research (Hill et al., 2012). In the control condition, participants viewed a series of images depicting objects commonly found in an office. We then examined their sense of control using a state version of an established measure (Lachman and Weaver, 1998). Results revealed that resource scarcity led to a decrease in sense of personal control among individuals who had relatively poorer childhoods. Importantly, these beliefs did not vary as function of respondents’ current economic conditions.

 

Study 2. If resource scarcity alters personal sense of control, as predicted by our model, then it should produce different patterns for personal and non-personal sense of control. We tested this possibility in Study 2. Participants read a news article either about the recent economic recession or a control article. Next, they responded to a six-item measure of personal sense of control and a six-item measure of others’ sense of control adapted from a validated scale (Dew & Xiao, 2011). Study 2 conceptually replicated the very specific finding from Study 1. In addition, it showed that this effect was specific to people’s personal sense of control rather than their more general perceptions about everyone’s level of control.

 

In Study 3, we aimed to show that perceptions of personal control mediate the relation between resource scarcity and impulsive financial behavior. Resource scarcity was manipulated using the procedure as in Study 1. Next, sense of control was measured using the same items as in Study 1. Finally, financial impulsivity was assessed using a set of randomly presented lotteries (Green & Myerson, 2004). Results indicated continued support for our initial predictions. Resource scarcity led individuals from relatively poorer backgrounds to feel a diminished sense of control as compared to individuals from relatively wealthier backgrounds. Furthermore, our mediated moderation analyses revealed that the influence of resource scarcity on people’s impulsive behavior was indeed statistically mediated by their sense of personal control.

 

Study 4 provided additional support for the mediating role of sense of personal control on impulsivity under resource scarcity. To provide further process evidence, we adopted a moderation-of-process experimental design in Study 4. Specifically, besides control and resource scarcity conditions, we included a third condition in which participants experienced a temporary boost in sense of control in addition to exposure to cues of resource scarcity (Whitson and Galinksy, 2008). All participants then responded to questions on impulsivity and childhood SES used in previous studies. We predicted that the observed effect of resource scarcity on impulsivity would be nullified for those experience a temporary boost in sense of control. The results were consistent with this prediction. Resource scarcity led people from poorer backgrounds to become significantly more impulsive as compared to people from poorer backgrounds. More importantly, we no longer found this effect in the condition where participants experienced a boost in sense of control despite being exposed to cues of resource scarcity.

 

In summary, the current research substantially extends previous work on the effects of resource scarcity on people’s psychologies and behaviors. We not only show that resource scarcity produces divergent control beliefs in people as a function of their childhood environments, but we also show that these beliefs may be driving important behaviors such as impulsivity. These findings have important implications for public policy interventions that wish to improve the future life conditions among the ones that are the most susceptible to the effects of resource scarcity. Our findings suggest that infusing a sense of personal control among such individuals may help in reducing impulsive financial behaviors resulting in greater consumer welfare.

综上所述，目前的研究在很大程度上扩展了以往关于资源短缺对人们心理和行为的影响的研究。我们不仅表明资源稀缺会使人们产生不同的控制信念，这是他们童年环境的一个功能，而且我们还表明，这些信念可能会推动重要的行为，如冲动。这些发现对那些希望改善未来生活条件的公共政策干预措施具有重要意义，而这些措施最容易受到资源短缺的影响。我们的研究结果表明，在这些人中注入个人控制感可能有助于减少冲动性金融行为，从而提高消费者福利。


# The Impact of Scarcity on Consumers’ Choices of Multiple Items from a Product Class 

Scarcity induces arousal (Brehm 1966; Berlyne 1969; Cialdini 2009), and arousal has been shown to alter attention allocation (Broadbent 1971; Easterbrook 1959; Kahneman 1973) giving rise to judgment polarization (Mano 1992; Paulhus and Lim 1994). scarcity of multiple items from a product class induces arousal, and that the heightened arousal polarizes the evaluations of individual items contained in the choice set, consequently in- creasing (decreasing) choices of the most-preferred (less-preferred) items.

 

The objective of Study 1 is to provide support for our main thesis that scarce (vs. abundant) supply of each alternative in a choice set polarizes the liking for the favorite versus non-favorites, and increases choices of the favorite item from the set. Participants were asked to imagine that they were shopping at a grocery shop and decided to buy four yogurts as there was a “Pick Any 4 for $1” sale. They were told that the store carries a total of five different yogurt flavors including strawberry, raspberry, vanilla, peach and lemon. Participants in the abundant (scarcity) condition were told that there were many (only a few) of each flavor, approximately 50 units (5 units) of each remaining. All participants were then asked to rank the five yogurt flavors according to their preference, rate how much they like each flavor, and finally indicate which four yogurts they would choose. As predicted, we find that scarce (vs. abundant) supply of each alternative in the choice set polarized liking of the favorite versus non-favorites, and led people to select more units of their favorite item from the set.

 

To examine whether the mere perception of scarcity is sufficient to trigger these effects, in Study 2, participants were presented with pictures of four types of ready-to-eat vegetables. In the scarcity (abundance) condition, eight pieces of vegetables of each type were provided in four transparent large, 32 oz. (small, 8 oz.) food containers. A separate manipulation check confirmed that participants perceived the same supply level of vegetables as more limited when it was provided in the large versus small food containers. Results of Study 2 provide converging evidence for our key proposition, demonstrating that perceived (instead of actual) scarce versus abundant supply also polarized liking ratings and increased choices of the favorite. Further, in Study 2 we added popularity measures to investigate the alternative explanation of perceived popularity, and found that neither absolute nor relative popularity of the favorite was significantly different across the scarcity and abundance conditions.

 

We subsequently present two additional experiments to provide direct support for the arousal-based theorizing, demonstrating that the effect of scarcity versus abundance on choices between the most and less-preferred alternatives is mediated by reported arousal level (Study 3) and attenuated by experimentally induced arousal state (Study 4). In Study 3, participants were asked to pick four $25 gifts cards from five different stores, and they were told that three participants in this study would be randomly selected to receive the four $25 gift cards picked by them (total worth $100). Consistent with our theorizing, scarcity increased choices of the favorite store’s gift card and the effect of supply level on gift card choices was mediated by reported arousal level. In Study 4, based on previous arousal research (Menon and Kahn 2002, Vosgerau 2010) showing that bright background color induces high-level of arousal, we manipulated a second factor, survey background color (arousing vs. control), in addition to supply level. Replicating previous results in another real choice context, subjects in the control conditions chose more pieces of their favorite candy in the scarcity versus abundance condition. Importantly, experimentally activating a high-arousal state for all participants through the bright background color eliminated the effects of the scarcity versus abundance condition on the number of pieces chosen of their favorite. Finally, Study 5 generalizes the proposed polarization effect to situations where a general sense of scarcity is activated. We find that activating the general concept of scarcity using a lexical decision task manipulation (Laran and Salerno 2012) also increased choices of the favorite item from a choice set.

To summarize, whereas prior research focused on how the scarcity of a single item impacts its attractiveness, here we examine how overall perception of scarcity across multiple items from a choice set influences choices of individual items in the set. We demonstrate that a uniform level of scarcity (vs. abundance) across items in a choice set increases choices of the most-preferred item, decreasing choices of the less-preferred items. We propose and find empirical support for an arousal-based polarization explanation.

 

 






# Bridging cultural sociology and cognitive psychology in three contemporary research programs 

\-       studies of poverty focused on scarcity and cognitive bandwidth (CB)

\-       Three prominent manifestations of this trend are the study of poverty focused on scarcity and cognitive bandwidth (CB);

Scholars have long debated why the poor so often remain in poverty. Culture of poverty arguments, which suggest that the poor are inhibited by deviant values or habits 17, have fallen out of favour 4. 

长期以来，学者们一直在争论为什么穷人总是处于贫困之中。贫困文化的论据表明，穷人受到背离的价值观或习惯的抑制。

 

The “cognitive bandwidth” approach provides new insights into cognitive processes underlying these behaviours by examining decision-making in the context of scarcity. The universal cognitive processes it identifies reveal commonalities between the poor and the middle class that help readers understand apparently irrational behaviour.

“认知带宽”方法通过在稀缺的情况下检查决策，为这些行为背后的认知过程提供了新的见解。它所确定的普遍认知过程揭示了穷人和中产阶级之间的共性，帮助读者理解明显的非理性行为。

 

In Scarcity and related articles (e.g., Bertrand, Mullainathan, and Shafir 19; Mani et al. 20), economist Sendhil Mullainathan and psychologist Eldar Shafir propose that when people feel they have insufficient time, money, or food, they focus exclusively on managing the scarce resource. This heightened focus, or “tunnelling,” has benefits: by ignoring irrelevant issues, we make better use of cognitive capacities to solve the focal problem, yielding a “focus dividend.” People with scarce resources are more economically rational with regard to the specific scarce resource than those with abundant resources 21.

在稀缺性和相关文章中（如Bertrand、Mullainathan和Shafir 19；Mani等人20），经济学家sendhil mullainathan和心理学家eldar shafir提出，当人们感到时间、金钱或食物不足时，他们只专注于管理稀缺的资源。这种高度集中或“隧道挖掘”有好处：通过忽略不相关的问题，我们更好地利用认知能力来解决焦点问题，产生“焦点红利”。资源稀缺的人在特定稀缺资源方面更具经济理性21。

For the poor, the pressing need to focus on short-term economic requirements inhibits long-term planning, leading to future scarcity; tunnelling thus becomes not only an effect but also a cause of poverty. For the businessman with scarce time to meet work deadlines, tunnelling will lead him to neglect his family: “projects must be finished now; the children will be there tomorrow” 18.

对于穷人来说，迫切需要关注短期经济需求，这会抑制长期规划，导致未来的稀缺性；因此，隧道挖掘不仅是一种效果，而且也是造成贫困的一个原因。对于那些没有时间完成工作期限的商人来说，挖掘隧道会导致他忽视自己的家庭：“现在必须完成项目，明天孩子们将在那里”18。






# The Impact of Resource Scarcity on Price-Quality Judgments

**资源稀缺性会降低消费者使用价格来判断产品质量的倾向。也就是说，当你感到资源稀缺的时候，你更不会用价格的高低来判断一种商品的质量好坏。**

 

首先，研究者找了87名MTurk的参与者做了一个实验。参与者被随机分为两组。一半的人需要花3分钟写一篇关于自己成长过程中拥有稀缺资源的文章，这是为了让他们产生稀缺的感觉；另一半的人则需要写下他们在过去一周所做的事情，这作为实验的控制组。

 

接下来，参与者需要仔细阅读一个33台摄像机的列表清单信息（如图2）。这份清单是几种不同品牌摄像机的信息，包括品牌名称、原产国、型号、质量评分（1-100分）和平均零售价格。

 

然后，参与者看了10个其他品牌摄像机（如“A品牌摄像机”）的平均零售价格，并要求仅根据价格信息来对这些摄像机的质量分别打分。质量评分估值的范围是1-100分，分数越高，说明参与者觉得摄像机的质量应该更好。

研究者重点关注了其他品牌摄像机的给定价格与参与者质量评分估值之间的相关性。结果发现，与控制组相比（M = .65），稀缺条件下的参与者给出的质量估值与给定价格之间的相关性更小（M = .46）。也就是说，当人们感到资源稀缺时，会减少人们用价格高低来判断产品质量好坏的倾向。

 

那么，当资源稀缺时，为什么人们更不会使用价格来判断产品质量呢？研究者又做了一系列实验发现，**当人们觉得资源稀缺时，他们更想要弥补这种短缺，更想要追求一种富足（****abundance****）的状态。**

 

**这种对富足状态的追求会让人们更不想要对物品进行分类（对物品分类会带来一种减少的感觉），更不想要将产品分类为不同的价格，从而更不会用价格的高低来判断一种产品质量的好坏。**

 

消费者经常觉得越贵的东西质量越好，经常无意识地通过价格高低来直接判断产品质量的好坏。什么时候消费者更不会用价格来判断产品质量呢？ 这篇文章的研究告诉我们：**资源稀缺性会降低消费者使用价格来判断产品质量的倾向。**

 

对于营销者来说，如果你的产品价格很低，那么你更应该避免让消费者通过价格来判断产品质量；但是如果你的产品价格很高，那么你更应该让消费者通过价格来判断产品质量。

 

 

 

Consumers routinely encounter situations in which they perceive that resources are scarce. However, little is known about how this perception influences consumers’ use of price in their purchase decisions.

消费者通常会遇到他们认为资源稀缺的情况。然而，这种认知如何影响消费者在购买决策中对价格的使用却鲜为人知。

 

The present research seeks to fill this gap by examining the link between scarcity and the tendency to use price to judge product quality, and the mechanisms underlying that link.

目前的研究试图通过检验稀缺性和用价格来判断产品质量的趋势之间的联系，以及这种联系背后的机制来填补这一空白。

 

Scarcity induces a desire to compensate for the shortage and seek abundance, and thereby reduces an individual’s general categorization tendency (because categorizing brings about a feeling of reduction); this, in turn, hinders consumers from viewing products as belonging to different price-tier groups, and thus lowers their tendency to use price as a basis for judging product quality. Boundary conditions for the proposed effect are also identified. The current research makes fundamental contributions to the literatures on scarcity, price-quality judgments, and categorization.

稀缺性导致人们渴望弥补短缺并寻求丰裕，从而降低了个人的总体分类倾向（因为分类带来了减少的感觉）；这反过来又阻碍了消费者将产品视为属于不同价格层的产品从而降低了将价格作为判断产品质量的依据的倾向。文中还给出了该效应的边界条件。目前的研究成果对稀缺性、价格质量判断和分类等方面的文献做出了基础性的贡献。

 

Consumers often perceive that resources are scarce. Monthly bills often remind them of limited monetary resources, and approaching deadlines create the perception that time is scarce (Shah, Mullainathan, and Shafir 2012). More broadly, people regularly experience or hear about economic crises, natural disasters, and social disturbances (Griskevicius et al. 2013), which evokes a general perception that resources in the world are scarce (Laran and Salerno 2012).

消费者通常认为资源是稀缺的。每月的账单常常会让他们想起有限的货币资源，而临近最后期限会让他们产生时间稀缺的感觉（Shah、Mullainathan和Shafir 2012）。更广泛地说，人们经常经历或听说经济危机、自然灾害和社会动乱（Griskevicius等人，2013年），这唤起了人们对世界资源稀缺的普遍看法（Laran和Salerno，2012年）。

 

research indicates that scarcity limits an individual’s cognitive capacity (Cialdini 1993; Easterbrook 1959; Mani et al. 2013), and that reduced cognitive capacity increases the use of mental shortcuts such as price-quality heuristics (Kardes et al. 2004; Rao 2005; Rao and Monroe 1988). Collectively, these works point to a possible positive association between scarcity and price-quality judgments.

研究表明，稀缺性限制了个体的认知能力（cialdini 1993；easterbrook 1959；mani et al.2013年），认知能力的降低增加了心理捷径的使用，如价格质量启发式（Kardes等人，2004年；rao 2005年；rao和monroe 1988年）。总的来说，这些研究指出了稀缺性和价格质量判断之间可能存在的积极联系。

 

Specifically, we postulate that scarcity is aversive and triggers the desire to compensate for the shortage, and to seek abundance (Cialdini 2001). This abundance-seeking reduces individuals’ general tendency to categorize objects and to view products as belonging to different price-tier groups, and thus lowers their tendency to use price as a basis for judging products’ quality.

我们假设稀缺性是厌恶的，并引发了弥补短缺和寻求富足的欲望（cialdini 2001）。这种追求丰富度的行为降低了个体对产品进行分类和将产品视为属于不同价格层次群体的总体倾向，从而降低了他们将价格作为判断产品质量的依据的倾向。

 

**Scarcity Manipulation.** Following Mehta and Zhu (2015), participants in the scarcity condition took three minutes to write an essay about growing up having scarce resources. Participants in the control condition wrote about the things they did during the past week.

 

**Scarcity Manipulation****.** Following Roux, Goldsmith, and Bonezzi (2015), participants in the scarcity condition wrote about times when they “didn’t have enough of something” or “resources were scarce.” Participants in the control condition wrote about the things they did during the past week. 

**Cognitive Constraint Manipulation***.* Cognitive constraint was manipulated as part of a quality estimation task similar to that used in study 1A. Specifically, in the beginning of the quality estimation task, participants in the high cognitive constraint condition were told that an additional objective of the task is to investigate how well people can perform two different tasks simultaneously. They were told that, as another task, they would be given an eight-digit number and asked to perform the quality estimation task while holding this eight-digit number in memory (Gilbert and Hixon 1991). Participants in the control cognitive constraint condition were given no instructions about the eight-digit number and directly performed the quality estimation task. 

 

**Scarcity Manipulation.** A scarcity manipulation similar to that used in study 1B was used. Participants in the scarcity condition wrote three episodes in which they “didn’t have enough of something” or “resources were scarce,” then chose one of the episodes and described it in detail, explaining what they experienced and what it felt like to be in that situation. Participants in the control condition listed three things they did during the past week, then chose one of those things and described it in detail.

 

**Desire for abundance** was assessed using a 7-point (1 = not at all, 7 = definitely), 3 item scale; “I desire to have a lot of things,” “I desire to own a lot of things,” and “Having a lot of things makes me happy.” The ratings for these items were averaged (α = .95) to form the desire for abundance index. 

**Desire for Abundance Manipulation.** Desire for abundance was manipulated first. Participants in the low desire for abundance condition read that “There are times when having a lot of things can make life very inconvenient, like when you are moving to a new house, when you are packing for travel, or when you are choosing between too many choice options.” Then, participants imagined such a situation and wrote in detail about the ways in which having a lot of things might make their life worse. Participants in the control desire for abundance condition wrote about the things they did during the past week. 

 

**Scarcity** was measured by asking the following four questions: “I feel that I do not have enough of something,” “I grew up with scarce resources,” “I often think of the scarcity issues I experience,” and “I feel I might lack resources in the future,” on a 7-point scale (1 = not at all, 7 = definitely). The ratings for these items were averaged (α = .72) to form the scarcity measure.

 






# Mere experience of low subjective socioeconomic status stimulates appetite and food intake

 

2017年，来自新加坡南洋理工大学的Bobby K. Cheon和香港中文大学的Ying-Yi Hong在《美国国家科学院院刊》（PNAS）上发表了一个研究。他们发现**，当人们感到自己的社会经济地位较低的时候，他们会更喜欢吃高热量的食物（如披萨、汉堡包），会从零食和正餐中摄入更多的热量。**

 






# The Fun and Function of Uncertainty: Uncertain Incentives Reinforce Repetition Decisions

 

没错，比起确定的奖赏来说，不确定的奖赏能够更好的激励我们。来自香港中文大学的沈璐希和芝加哥大学的Christopher Hsee教授在《消费者研究杂志》上发表的一篇文章，考察了不确定性奖励的激励作用。

 

在第一个实验中，他们选择了香港中文大学健身俱乐部的82名新成员作为参与者。在15天的时间里，新成员可以通过每天绕操场跑圈的方式来获得会员积分，这些积分可以在15天结束之后兑换等额的港币在校园咖啡馆中消费。也就是说，15天后如果你有200的积分，你就可以在学校咖啡馆免费喝累计价值200块的咖啡。

 

实验将新成员们随机分成两组，确定奖励组和不确定奖励组。在确定奖励组中，他们每跑一圈，就能获得5积分；不确定奖励组中，他们每跑一圈，可能获得3个积分，也可能获得5个积分。每天跑步之后，成员们会收到信息，得知自己今天赚到的积分以及到今天为止累计的积分。15天结束后，研究人员分析了两组人的跑步次数。哪一组人跑得更多呢？数据分析结果表明，不确定奖励组平均跑了13.93圈，要显著高于确定奖励组成员跑的圈数（M=7.45）。也就是说，不确定的积分奖励更能激励人们跑步。

 

为什么呢？为什么我们更容易受到不确定的激励呢？研究者在下一个实验中为我们揭晓了答案。

 

他们在芝加哥大学的实验室里进行了一项培训计算能力的实验。100个人需要参加一个计算考试，这个考试还有20分钟才举行。因此在这20分钟内，人们可以自愿进行计算练习，每完成一组练习就会获得一些星星，这些星星可以用来兑换糖果。比如，在考试前你可以通过训练赚了30颗星星，那么你就可以换取30颗糖。

 

参加考试的人一共分为三组，第一组为确定奖励组，他们每完成一组训练会得到两个星星的奖励；第二组为不确定奖励（及时奖励）组，他们每完成一组训练可能得到一个，但是也有可能会得到两个星星，并且每完成一轮，就揭晓这一轮自己获得星星的个数；第三组为不确定奖励（延迟奖励）组，他们跟第二组人一样，同样接受一个或者两个星星的不确定奖励，但不一样的是，每一轮训练结束后他们并不知道自己在这一轮得到了多少，而是等到最后才知道累计的星星总数。

 

实验结果表明，第二组人进行的训练次数是最多的（M=8.62），如果人们不知道自己每一轮到底能得到多少星星，人们会做更多训练来赚取星星。

 

但是，如果人们不能每一轮结束的时候就知道自己得到了多少星星的话，那么他们的动力也大大减少。第三组人训练的次数（M=3.74）甚至还要低于第一组确定奖励的人（M=4.85）。这说明了如果不能得到及时反馈的话，不确定奖赏也可能失去作用。

 

**及时地给予人们一个不确定的奖赏，这会激发人们的动力。**

 

为什么不确定奖励会更能激励人们的行为呢？因为不确定性奖励就像一个解谜的过程，当我们得到了谜底，不仅收获了奖励，还会收获把不确定转变成确定的满足感。

 

就像我们收到的微信红包，每次看到有红包出现，人们就会赶紧点开。有时候还会点开看看别人拿了多少钱。微信红包的快乐是双重的，一来让我们得到了钱，二来还让我们看到了谜底。

 

因此，一个包了五毛钱的红包能让你迫不及待打开，感到很快乐。但如果看到眼前的地面上有五毛钱，你却不一定愿意去捡。






# Experimental Scarcity Increases the Relative Reinforcing Value of Food in Food Insecure Adults 

People with fewer financial resources are at greater risk for obesity, but the mechanisms of this relationship are not fully understood.

 

One factor that is related, both cross-sectionally and prospectively, to obesity is the relative reinforcing value of food. It is possible that the experience of scarcity increases this reinforcing value.

 

Study 1 had a within-subjects design and included 25 adult males and females. Scarcity was manipulated by placing time and resources limits on the relative reinforcing value task and examining responding for a high calorie snack food versus that of an alternative reinforcer. 

 

Study 1 showed a tendency for food insecure participants to respond more for all reinforcers across conditions and a higher proportional response for food when resources were limited. Study 2 also made use of a within-subjects design with 30 males and females and primed scarcity by creating financial gains and losses on the Iowa Gambling Task. We observed increased relative reinforcing values of food among food insecure participants in the control and financial loss conditions. When taken together, these two studies suggest that individuals who report experiencing food insecurity respond to acute manipulations of scarcity by increasing their reinforcing value of snack food.

 

One possible mechanism for this relationship is that a perception of scarce resources, such as during periods of food insecurity, may increase the relative reinforcing value (RRV) of food, which in turn leads to increased energy consumption (Epstein et al., 2007). The RRV of food is the amount of work one is willing to perform in order to obtain food.

这种关系的一种可能机制是，对稀缺资源的感知，例如在粮食不安全时期，可能会增加粮食的相对强化价值（RRV），进而导致能源消耗增加RRV。食物的RRV是一个人为了获得食物而愿意做的工作量。

 

Shah, Mullainathan, and Shafir (2012) hypothesized that a mindset of scarcity, or a perception of having less than one needs, creates an attentional bias for the scarce resource to the detriment of other needs. This attentional bias, or scarcity mindset, may extend to any type of resource, including money, time, and food. Further, this attentional bias makes it extremely difficult to focus on other pressing needs (Shah, Mullainathan, & Shafir, 2012).

 

in the current food environment, a scarcity of food resources typically arises from a scarcity of financial resources. Although financial insecurity and food insecurity are separate constructs, they are highly related to one another (Alisha Coleman-Jensen, Nord, & Singh, 2013; Franklin et al., 2012).

 

When taken together, these studies provide strong evidence that a scarcity of food or financial resources has a strong effect on eating behavior.

 

**Scarcity Manipulation:** In order to manipulate perceptions of scarcity, we inserted a script after the second food reinforcer was earned. In the control condition, the experimenter entered the room and asked if the computer monitors were working properly. In the “resource- limited” condition, the participants were told that the laboratory was running low on the food that they were working for, but that they should continue to work for as much as they wanted and would be informed if we ran out. In reality, no limits were placed on the amount the participant could earn. In the “time-limited” condition, participants were told that due to scheduling difficulties, we would have to end the task in five-minutes, but that they should continue to work for food and/or reading if they wished. This time limit was placed on the task so that the participants did not become suspicious for later appointments.

稀缺操纵：为了操纵对稀缺的感知，我们在获得第二个食物强化物之后插入了一个脚本。在控制状态下，实验者进入房间，询问电脑显示器是否正常工作。在“资源有限”的情况下，参与者被告知实验室的食物不足，但他们应该继续为他们想要的食物工作，如果我们用完了，他们会得到通知。实际上，参与者的收入没有限制。在“有时间限制”的情况下，参与者被告知，由于日程安排问题，我们必须在5分钟内完成任务，但如果他们愿意，他们应该继续为食物和/或阅读工作。这一时限被定在任务上，以便参与者不会对以后的约会产生怀疑。

 

 

**Scarcity Manipulation**. In Study 2, we manipulated perceptions of financial scarcity by modifying the wins and losses in the Iowa Gambling Task (Franken, Georgieva, Muris, & Dijksterhuis, 2006). This computer-based task involved participants making choice between different ostensible decks of cards. Each deck had different monetary wins and losses associated with it and there was variability in the risk accompanying each deck. For 100 consecutive trials, participants were free to move between the different decks or stick with one and were able to observe the changes in their total winnings as the task progressed. In all three conditions, participants started the task with $5. The Control condition was the traditional Iowa Gambling Task, which ended with participants typically breaking even with $5 in winnings. In the Gain and Loss conditions, participants were presented with the same four decks, which were comprised of the same risk of winning and losing money. However, the amounts won and lost were altered in order to bias the game toward larger wins or larger losses accordingly. The games were pilot tested by non-participating students and research assistants in our laboratory, who were unaware of the purpose or parameters of the task. We used performance on the task in pilot sessions to tailor the winnings such that the typical gain winnings were +$10 and the loss winnings were -$10 from the starting $5. Participants were told at the beginning of the study that their winnings would be added together at the end of the study and they would be able to take home any accumulated winnings in the form of an additional gift card to Wegmans. In the event that they earned no extra money or lost money, they would still be paid the $25 for completing the study regardless.






# Scarcity Frames Value

Interestingly, classical economic predictions derive from a deeper assumption about scarcity, namely, that people treat all resources as limited. However, recent research suggests that scarcity is not a ubiquitous psychological reality. When people feel that resources are low relative to needs, a scarcity mind-set emerges, and it changes how they make decisions (Mani, Mullainathan, Shafir, & Zhao, 2013; Mullainathan & Shafir, 2013; Shah, Mullainathan, & Shafir, 2012). This raises a natural question: Are perceptions of value more stable (and therefore closer to the economic ideal) when people experience the scarcity mind-set?

 

有趣的是，经典的经济预测源自一个关于稀缺性的更深层次的假设，即人们将所有资源视为有限的。然而，最近的研究表明，稀缺并不是普遍存在的心理现实。当人们觉得资源相对于需求来说很低时，稀缺心态就会出现，它会改变他们做决定的方式（Mani、Mullainathan、Shafir和Zhao，2013；Mullainathan和Shafir，2013；Shah、Mullainathan和Shafir，2012）。这就提出了一个自然的问题：当人们体验到稀缺的心态时，价值观是否更稳定（因此更接近经济理想）？

 

This article examines this question. We tested how classic context effects change when participants experience scarcity and found that scarcity reduces or eliminates several kinds of context effects. Whereas previous work has focused on how scarcity negatively affects cognition (Haushofer & Fehr, 2014; Mani et al., 2013), here we document that under specific circumstances, scarcity brings decision making closer to normative predictions, which suggests that scarcity has more nuanced effects.

本文探讨这个问题。我们测试了当参与者体验到稀缺性时，经典语境效应是如何变化的，发现稀缺性减少或消除了几种语境效应。尽管之前的研究主要集中在稀缺性如何对认知产生负面影响（Haushofer&Fehr，2014；Mani等人，2013），但在这里，我们记录了在特定情况下，稀缺性使决策更接近于规范性预测，这表明稀缺性具有更细微的影响。

 

To appreciate how scarcity might influence context effects, consider the classic beer-on-the-beach scenario, in which people report their willingness to pay (WTP) for a beer that is purchased at either a fancy resort or a grocery store (Thaler, 1985). It is the same beer, consumed on the same beach, and yet people offer more money when they know it comes from the resort. Why?

要了解稀缺性可能对环境影响的程度，请考虑经典的“海滩啤酒”场景，在该场景中，人们会报告他们愿意为在高级度假村或杂货店购买的啤酒付费（Thaler，1985）。这是同样的啤酒，在同一个海滩上消费，但当人们知道它来自度假村时，他们会提供更多的钱。为什么？

 

Human judgment is inherently relative. People use contextual cues to interpret everything from color to size to value; when the context changes, so does their judgment.

人类的判断力天生是相对的。人们使用上下文提示来解释从颜色到大小到价值的一切；当上下文改变时，他们的判断也会随之改变。

 

时间压力—》消息加工深度和搜索信息模式

 

But scarcity generates different cues for deciding value. Under conditions of scarcity, pressing needs capture attention (Aarts, Dijksterhuis, & de Vries, 2001; Radel & Clément-Guillotin, 2012; Shah et al., 2012). When money is short, the utility bill and rent payment are on the top of one’s mind. These concerns make trade-offs, or opportunity costs, highly accessible: Buying one thing means giving up other things (Spiller, 2011). Someone contemplating purchasing a beer compares the beer with other budgetary demands, like tomorrow’s lunch or bus fare. And these trade-offs do not depend on where the beer is purchased. They lead the person to ignore irrelevant contextual cues and instead rely on his or her own standards. They provide an internal frame of reference that more steadily guides evaluations.

但稀缺性产生了不同的价值决定线索。在稀缺的条件下，迫切的需求引起了人们的注意。缺钱时，水电费和房租是最重要的。这些担忧使得权衡或机会成本变得非常容易获得：买一件东西意味着放弃其他东西（Spiller，2011）。有人考虑购买啤酒，将啤酒与其他预算需求（如明天的午餐或巴士费用）进行比较。而这些取舍并不取决于啤酒的购买地。它们会导致人们忽略无关的上下文线索，转而依赖自己的标准。它们提供了一个更稳定地指导评价的内部参照系。

 

Our main prediction was therefore that scarcity leads to more consistent valuation and reduces certain context effects.

您目前还是一名高校在读研究生，在某企业兼职实习，一天 的饭补也仅仅是50元钱(一天的饭补也仅是完整型套餐总金额 的1/2，平均的到每一顿仅仅是完整型套餐总金额的不到1/5)。 这虽然是个虚构生存状态，但却具有真实性，能使人联想到自身 处于校园穷学生时期的窘境，联想到自身的财务状况。当金钱的 稀缺俘获大脑时，人们的注意力会集中在缺钱这件事情上，并将 其他事物排除在外，即管窥效应:专注于某一事物就意味着我们 会忽略其他事物，也叫“隧道视野”。这种专注会让人们从稀缺中 获益，让人们获得“专注红利”，即不会随意因为快感而胡乱消 费。研究表明:只是单纯地引起低收入者对财务的顾虑，就会严 重地影响他们的认知表现能力，其严重性甚至超越了失眠所造 成的影响。因此，在决策快餐的附加选项时，稀缺者其实早已为 自己这顿饭规划了合理的心理账户分配，不会因为商家的产品 呈现方式有所差异而多花钱。 

稀缺，会导致不满，甚至抗争。面对金钱 稀缺的假设情景，消费者每多花一分钱他们的心情就会变得沉 重，会进行更多的心理博弈。此时消费者在不得不放弃手中金钱 时所感知到的痛苦与不能获得附加选项所带来更多效用时而感 知到的痛苦相比会更为敏感。 

稀缺会俘获我们的注意力，并带来一点点好处:我们能够在 应对迫切需求时，做的更好。无论是有关工作还是娱乐，只要时 间有限，我们都会尽量将其利用得淋漓尽致。我们将这种现象称 为“专注红利”，也就是稀缺俘获大脑时所产生的积极成果。专注 红利是人们在面临截止日期时有所提高的工作效率，是在玩家 们手中子弹数量较少时有所提高的射击精准度。专注红利来源 于我们提出的核心原理:稀缺俘获大脑。因此稀缺可以帮助我们 做成一些凭借自身力量很难做到的事情。麦当劳快餐附加选项 的自主决策之所以受到欢迎, 是因为它们更能满足消费者的特 殊需要。但近来的一些研究表明，当商家提供的产品呈现方式发 生变化时(加法、减法框架)，消费者最终选择的产品也随之变 化，这说明消费者的决策行为会偏离古典经济学预测的理性行 为。然而金钱的稀缺让消费者又回归于理性，并且在做减法时还 不断有稀缺物的流入，因而产生了额外的选择乐趣，也因为自身 的理性决策行为而更有满足感。 

在稀缺情境下，只单纯 地引起低收入者对财务的顾虑，就会严重影响他们的认知表现 能力，对于金钱的稀缺产生的管窥效应带给了消费者专注红利， 使得消费者更加理性消费。

已有研究表明，产品的稀缺诉求会对消费者的价值感知和购买决策产生重要影响，如影响消费者的产品吸引力感、获得性期望、产品昂贵性、产品质量甚至个人品味等【4】

 

NICHOLS[7]研究发现，通过操控产品的稀缺性会唤起消费者的感知竞争性，从而促使消费者加速购买决策和增强支付意愿;

 

AGGARWAL etal.[8]研究发现，竞争赢得稀缺性产品会让消费者认为产品更有价值，也更有成就感。

 

目前国内外对产品稀缺诉求引发消费者的感知竞争性和感知欺骗性缺乏整合研究，不仅影响稀缺效应的理论发展，也影响厂商的稀缺性营销操作和消费者的消费行为。

 

BROCK[13]的商品理论认为任何商品都可以在一定程度上被认为是稀缺的、不可得的或者是得到很困难的。而可得性受限的商品会让其更有价值[14]。产品稀缺性就是指由于产品供给不足或获取时间有限而导致产品难以得到[15]。已有研究表明，产品稀缺会产生稀缺效应[15]，ORUC[4]通过元分析发现稀缺会影响消费者的16种消费感知或行为，具体包括感知稀缺、支付意愿、消费数量、感知质量、感知流行性、想法加工、想法效价、竞争性唤醒、冲动购买、交易态度、产品态度、交易意愿、感知价值、购买行为、购买意愿、感知专有性等。研究发现大多数的结果都具有积极意义，甚至某些消费者将稀缺信号视为产品价值、产品质量和身份消费的“启发式线索”[16]

稀缺感与个体拥有资源的绝对数量无关，而与个体的资源持有量和需求总量之间的相对数量缺口 有关。因此，不管人们事实上持有的资源数量有多少，当其感知到资源不能满足自身需要时，都会产生 稀缺感。以金钱资源为例，不止收入水平低的穷人存在稀缺感，收入水平高的富人在面临数量巨大的开 销时也会被触发稀缺感( Tully et al，2015) 5

 

以往针对稀缺感的营销研究主要聚焦在商品稀缺给消费者选择带来的影响，强调由于有限供给和 庞大需求的不一致，凸显出商品的稀有性和宝贵性，从而满足消费者标识其社会地位的需要( Lynn， 1992) 6，昭示个体的与众不同，进而增强消费者对产品的渴求和购买冲动。随着研究的深入，稀缺感对 个体的心理和行为产生影响，例如稀缺感会影响个体的反社会行为( Prediger et al，2014) 7、怨恨情绪( Gardner & West，2004) 1、创新行为( Mehta & Zhu，2015) 2、餍足曲线( Sevilla & Redden，2014) 3等。

 

当个体感觉到资源稀缺时，竞争性思维模式( Competitive Mindset) 会被激发( Grossman & Mendoza，2003) 4。这是因为在人类漫长的进化过程中，随着争夺稀缺资源行为的重复发生，这种思维模式已被 深深印刻在人类的行为模式中。而由资源稀缺导致的竞争性思维模式下，个体将会在保证现有资源不 流失的前提下，尽力争取更多资源，并且会考虑如何将资源投入到最能满足自身基本需求、不浪费的活 动中。这种保证安全、避免损失的行为取向正好与预防导向目标相一致( Goncalo & Staw，2006) 5。由 此可以看出，当个体感知到资源稀缺时，个体将会被激发竞争性思维模式，进而会采用以防卫为主的预 防导向来进行决策。

 

原因在于消费者感知到稀缺后，会启动生存思维模式( Survival Mind- set) 和竞争性思维模式( Competitive Mindset)。前者导致个体更倾向于选用直接、高效的方法来满足需求。

 

产品稀缺诉求(Product Scarcity Appeals，PSA)是 指企业通过传播或促销等方式向目标消费者公开或暗示 预售产品或服务可能存在数量不足的信息，以此来唤起 消费者的注意和购买。
