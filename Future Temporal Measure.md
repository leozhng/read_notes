# temporal focus

- Temporal Focus Measure. To assess temporal focus, we used an expanded measure from Winterich and Haws (2011; study 3). Specifically, immediately after the motivation manipulation, participants reported the importance of the present versus the future using five items: 

  - Immediate, day-to-day needs (1) – Future needs (9); 

  - Being comfortable right now (1) – Being comfortable in the future (9);

  - Focusing on present needs (1) – Focusing on future needs (9); 

  - Making sure needs are met right now (1) – Making sure needs are met in the future (9); 

  - Making sure immediate needs are met (1) – Making sure future needs are met (9).

    

# 「JCR, 2014」Helpful Hopefulness: The Effect of Future
Positive Emotions on Consumption

- The previous studies focused on understanding the relationship between positive emotions and temporal focus as they together affect self-control. In our final study, we examine whether or not the positive impact of future-focus on self-control arose from temporal focus alone (Fujita et al. 2006) or if a combination of positive affect and future-focus drove the results. Past research generally affirms the benefits of positive affect (Andrade 2005; Frederickson 2001; Lyubomirsky et al. 2005) and the detrimental influence of negative emotions (Garg et al. 2007; Labroo and Patrick 2009). However, is this always the case? Is it possible that negative emotions that are more future-focused (e.g., fear) may show self-control-enhancing effects similar to such positive emotions?
- 先前的研究集中在了解积极情绪和时间焦点之间的关系，因为它们共同影响自我控制。在我们的最后一项研究中，我们研究了未来专注于自我控制的积极影响是否仅仅来自于时间专注（Fujita等人，或者如果积极影响和未来关注的结合推动了结果。过去的研究通常肯定积极影响的好处（Andrade 2005；Frederickson 2001；Lyubomirsky等人以及消极情绪的有害影响（Garg等人，2007年；拉布鲁和帕特里克2009年）。然而，总是这样吗？更关注未来的消极情绪（如恐惧）是否可能表现出类似于这种积极情绪的自我控制增强效应？

- Contrasting the effects of a series of both positive and negative emotions that all share a similar future-focus will provide additional insights into the role that the valence of the emotion plays in determining the resulting effects of temporal focus on unhealthy consumption. Examining future-focused negative emotions also provides the opportunity to determine whether anxiety, associated with future-focused emotions such as hope and fear, may be driving our results. If the positive effect of hopefulness and other future-focused positive emotions on self-control arises from anxiety, then both fear and hopefulness should have less unhealthy consumption. Additionally, examining the role of future-focus on self-control for both positive and negative emotions allows us to provide a clearer understanding of the effects presented in this work in regard to work by Patrick and colleagues (Labroo and Patrick 2009; Patrick et al. 2009).
- 对比所有具有相似未来焦点的一系列积极和消极情绪的影响，将为情绪效价在确定时间关注对不健康消费的影响所起的作用提供额外的见解。 检查以未来为中心的负面情绪也提供了一个机会，可以确定与未来关注的情绪（如希望和恐惧）相关的焦虑是否会推动我们的结果。 如果充满希望和其他以未来为中心的积极情绪对自我控制产生的积极影响来自于焦虑，那么恐惧和希望都应该减少不健康的消费。 此外，检查未来关注积极和消极情绪的自我控制的作用，使我们能够更清楚地了解帕特里克及其同事在工作中所产生的影响（Labroo和Patrick 2009; Patrick等人 .2009）。
- Although examining the effects of distinct positive emotions is quite challenging due to their limited differentiation relative to negative emotions (Cavanaugh et al. 2007; Ells- worth and Smith 1988), we develop a richer understanding of the effects of discrete positive emotions on consumer behavior by identifying temporal focus to be a particularly important appraisal in self-control dilemmas. Perhaps temporal focus has been left largely unexamined due to being subsumed under certainty (Reisenzein and Hofmann 1990), yet we propose that temporal focus deserves further research as some appraisals may be more important in distinguishing emotions from one another (Ellsworth and Smith 1988).
- 虽然检验积极情绪的作用是非常具有挑战性的，因为它们相对于负面情绪的分化有限（Cavanaugh等人2007; Ells-值和史密斯1988），我们对离散积极情绪对消费者行为的影响有了更丰富的理解。通过确定时间焦点是对自我控制困境的一个特别重要的评价。由于被置于确定之下（Reisenzein和Hofmann，1990），时间焦点可能在很大程度上未经审查，但我们认为时间焦点值得进一步研究，因为一些评估在区分情绪方面可能更为重要（Ellsworth和Smith 1988）。
- We focused on positive emotions and corresponding temporal focus in self-control dilemmas because the temporal appraisal (past vs. future) maps onto self-control dilemmas between short- and long-term goals (Fujita et al. 2006; Hoch and Loewenstein 1991). Despite our efforts to address other related appraisals that may underlie our effects (e.g., by manipulating temporal focus in study 3 and controlling for arousal and anxiety in several studies), future research should examine the relationship between future temporal focus and affective components such as anxiety and uncertainty, as a future-focus is likely to elicit feelings of anxiety and thoughts of uncertainty (Ellsworth and Smith 1988; McGregor et al. 2010).
- 我们关注自我控制困境中的积极情绪和相应的时间焦点，因为时间评估（过去与未来）映射到短期和长期目标之间的自我控制困境（Fujita et al.2006; Hoch and Loewenstein 1991） 。尽管我们努力解决可能影响我们效应的其他相关评估（例如，通过操纵研究3中的时间焦点并控制几项研究中的唤醒和焦虑），未来的研究应该检查未来时间焦点与情感成分（如焦虑）之间的关系和不确定性，因为未来的焦点可能会引起焦虑和不确定性的感觉（Ellsworth和Smith 1988; McGregor et al.2010）。
- In addition, future research should seek to identify those appraisal dimensions that can best distinguish the often co-occurring positive emotions, the interplay among them, and how these appraisals lead to different behavioral outcomes. For instance, though hopefulness may be the most forward-looking emotion, making it distinct from pride and happiness on the temporal appraisal, the specific appraisals that distinguish other positive emotions such as contentment, joy, excitement, and amusement should also be examined. Although we do not believe that control appraisals explain our results, research should examine whether consumer decisions influenced by controls such as punishment or confidence differ based on specific positive emotions. Addition- ally, some research has considered the effect of distinct positive emotions in processing (Aaker, Drolet, and Griffin 2008) and product evaluations (Griskevicius et al. 2010), but future research should examine other consumer decisions that are likely to be influenced by temporal focus, such as risk-taking (Sagristano, Trope, and Liberman 2002). Consider also the potential for positive emotions to lead one to become more complacent with respect to one’s goals. This complacency may not result from the temporal focus of the emotion but from an appraisal of situational control. If this is the case, what positive emotions are distinct in situational control appraisals, and how do the corresponding appraisal tendencies influence consumer behavior?
- 此外，未来的研究应该寻求识别那些能够最好地区分经常共存的积极情绪，它们之间的相互作用以及这些评估如何导致不同行为结果的评估维度。例如，虽然希望可能是最前瞻性的情感，使其与时间评价中的骄傲和幸福区别开来，但也应该检查区分其他积极情绪的特定评价，例如满足，快乐，兴奋和娱乐。虽然我们不相信控制评估可以解释我们的结果，但研究应该检查受惩罚或信心等控制影响的消费者决策是否因具体的积极情绪而异。另外，一些研究已经考虑了不同积极情绪在处理（Aaker，Drolet和Griffin 2008）和产品评估（Griskevicius等人，2010）中的影响，但未来的研究应该检查可能受影响的其他消费者决策。通过时间焦点，例如risk-taking（Sagristano，Trope和Liberman，2002）。还要考虑积极情绪的可能性，使人们对自己的目标变得更加自满。这种自满情绪可能不是由情绪的时间焦点引起的，而是来自对情境控制的评价。如果是这种情况，情景控制评估中哪些积极情绪是不同的，相应的评估倾向如何影响消费者行为？
