## Transcranial direct current stimulation modulates ERP-indexed inhibitory control and reduces food consumption 

### Abstract

- Food craving can be defined as the “urge to eat a specific food”. 
- Impairment of inhibitory control, specifically a regulatory deficit in the lateral prefrontal circuitry that is associated with a compulsion for food. 
- As demonstrated by three previous studies, bilateral transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (anode right/cathode left) reduces food craving and caloric intake. 
- We designed the present study to evaluate the neural mechanisms that underlie these effects. 
  - We replicated the design of one of these previous studies but included electroencephalographic assessments to register evoked potentials in a Go/No-go task that contained pictures of food and furniture (a control visual stimulus). 
  - We observed that active DLPFC tDCS (anode right/ cathode left), compared with sham stimulation, reduced the frontal N2 component and enhanced the P3a component of responses to No-go stimuli, regardless of the stimulus condition (food or furniture). 
  - Active tDCS was also associated with a reduction in caloric intake. 
- We discuss our findings in the context of cortico-subcortical processing of craving and tDCS effects on inhibitory control neural circuitry.

###Introduction

Par 1:

- The concept of food craving

- A regulatory deficit in the lateral prefrontal circuitry that is associated with compulsion for food reinforces the notion of impairment of inhibitory control that is related to food craving (Uher et al., 2004). 
- Obese individuals, who often experience food cravings, suffer from impairments in dopaminergic pathways that are associated with reward sensitivity, incentive motivation, self-control and interoceptive awareness (Volkow, Wang, Tomasi, & Baler, 2013).

Par 2:

- Several studies have explored the mechanisms that underlie food craving to develop new treatments (Kringelbach & Stein, 2010).
  - Studies that used event-related potentials (ERPs) have provided significant mechanistic insights into food craving. 
  - Food pictures have been related to larger positive potentials of approximately 300 ms (P3b) and late positive potential (LPP) amplitudes in central and posterior electrodes, and these responses are associated with self-reported hunger (Gable & Harmon-Jones, 2010; Nijs, Franken, & Muris, 2008).
  - These higher amplitudes suggest higher motivated attention to food stimuli in
    individuals who have some type of food compulsion or during hunger.

Par 3:

- In this context, such noninvasive brain stimulation techniques as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can be used in combination with electroencephalography (EEG) to provide additional mechanistic insights.
- tDCS is known to modulate brain activity in a polarity-dependent fashion, i.e., **anodal stimulation** typically **increases neural firing** while cathodal stimulation has the opposite effect (Nitsche et al., 2008).
- These effects may also depend on the parameters of the stimulation (such as duration and intensity). 
- *Neuromodulation of frontal circuitry results in greater control over craving, possibly by regulating the release of dopamine and norepinephrine by means of top-down control mechanisms.*
- Kekic et al. (2014) reported *reduced craving for sweet foods after DLPFC stimulation (anode right/cathode left),* and also that individuals with more reflective choice behaviors showed a greater reduction in craving. 
- The neural effects that underlie the effects of brain stimulation on craving are not yet known.

Par 4:

- We aimed to evaluate the cognitive ERPs that are associated with the effects of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tDCS on food craving. 
  - Because our previous behavioral study had shown positive effects on food craving modulation (Fregni et al., 2008a), we used a similar design but included EEG to register ERPs during a Go/No-go task that contained pictures of food and furniture. 
  - The Go/No-go paradigm allows testing of the neural networks that are associated with motivational processes and inhibitory control. 
  - Additionally, we chose to test only an anode-right/cathode-left montage because that stimulation had stronger effects than cathode-right/anode-left stimulation (Fregni et al., 2008a). 
  - Two inhibitory frontocentral components are commonly reported during
    No-go stimuli. 
    - The **N2 component** is described as initial suppression or conflict detection in response to the stimulus
    - the **P3a** is related to inhibition of an overt response (Gajewski & Falkenstein, 2013; Yin & Liu, 2010). 
    - In contrast, Go stimuli are commonly associated with an increased **P3b** amplitude (Falkenstein, Hoormann, & Hohnsbein, 1999) that is similar to the response to salient stimuli and thus seems to reflect increased motivation.

Par 5:

- We hypothesized that 
  - right DLPFC anodal tDCS would decrease food craving by increasing inhibitory control, thus we predicted reduced N2 and increased P3a amplitudes. 
  - Active tDCS would decrease oriented attention to food stimuli, as reflected by decreased P3b amplitude compared with sham.

### Method

#### Study protocol

- The study design was similar to that of Fregni et al. (2008b), but we choose to use only anode-right/cathode-left stimulation, which had yielded stronger effects in the previous study.

- We included a Go-No-go task that was to be performed during EEG recording. 

- Because the brain reward system responds more strongly when subjects are not satiated (De Silva, Salem, Matthews, & Dhillo, 2012), volunteers were instructed to come 3 h after breakfast or lunch. 

- Demographic and food habit profile data were collected at baseline. A series of evaluative instruments were used.

  - **Baseline craving evaluation**, in which subjects were instructed to complete a visual analogue scale (VAS) for the urge to eat (0–10, with 0 corresponding to no urge to eat and 10 corresponding to an extremely strong urge to eat). 

  - **Food craving induction/manipulaiton**, in which subjects were exposed to a 5-min movie that showed scenes of food that usually elicit craving (e.g., cakes, sweets). Following this, they were seated for 5 min in front of a large table that contained different types of food that are locally preferred in Sao Paulo, Brazil: 

     • coconut candy (“*beijinho*” in Brazil)
     • homemade chocolate candy (“*brigadeiro*” in Brazil) 

     • peanut candy (“*paçoca*” in Brazil)
     • chocolate wafers
     • chocolate and vanilla cake
     • chocolate candies (“*bis*” and “*confete*” in Brazil)
     • toast
     • cheese
     • salami 

  - **Perception of food**, in which subjects were instructed to complete a visual analogue scale (VAS) for appearance, smell and taste of the exposed food: 

    - **Appearance** (0–10 with 0 corresponding to very poor ap- pearance and 10 corresponding to the best food appearance). 
    - **Smell** (0–10 with 0 corresponding to a very unpleasant smell and 10 corresponding to a very pleasant smell). 
    - **Taste** (0–10 with 0 corresponding to being extremely dis- tasteful and 10 corresponding to the best taste). This item was evaluated only after treatment when subjects were allowed to eat *ad libitum* (i.e., subjects were invited to eat as much as they wanted of the foods that we offered them). 

  - Subjects underwent an eye-tracking task (described below). 

  - Subjects underwent tDCS treatment for 20 min (detailed above), and then (after tDCS) their urge to eat was reassessed.

  - Subjects underwent a Go/No-go task that contained food and neutral (furniture) pictures during EEG recording (detailed below).

  - The evaluations of pre-treatment food craving and the procedure to induce craving, which had been the first two evaluations, were repeated.

  - The eye-tracking task was repeated (described below).

  - The VAS food craving assessment was repeated again, and subjects were then left alone in a room alone and allowed to eat *ad libitum*. We assessed the quantity (in calories) that was eaten by each subject, by counting the calories of the eaten items. The participants were also asked to rate the taste of the food from 0 to 10 (“0” the worst food ever; “10” the best food ever). 

- *tDCS* 

  - This study was a crossover study in which participants received two interventions: 
    - active tDCS, anode right/cathode left, according to the EEG 10–20 system F4 and F3, respectively
    - sham tDCS, in which the electrodes were placed at the same positions as in the active tDCS stimulation but the stimulator was turned off after 30 s of stimulation. 
    - A specially developed, battery-driven, constant current stimulator was used to deliver tDCS through 35 $cm^2$ rubber electrodes. 
      - For active stimulation, the current was ramped up for 15 s until it reached 2 $mA$, and subjects were stimulated for 20 min. The current was then ramped down for 15 s before it was turned off. 
      - For sham stimulation, the current was ramped up until it reached 2 mA, and it was then ramped down and turned off. 
      - There was a 1-week interval between sessions to avoid carryover effects. A Latin square design was used to randomize and counterbalance the order of stimulation across subjects. 
      - Participants and raters were blind to the treatment condition. 
      - All stimulation sessions were carried out by the same researchers and at the same time of day.

- *Go/No-go task* 

  - This cognitive task was created with E-Prime software and consisted of 10 blocks that each contained 15 food pictures and 15 furniture pictures. 
  - Each picture was presented for 500 ms with a random interstimulus interval that ranged from 1100 to 1600 ms. 
  - Food pictures were specified as targets (subjects were instructed to press a key when exposed to food pictures) in half of the blocks, and furniture pictures were specified as targets in the other half. 
  - Participants were requested to respond to targets by an immediate button press, but to withhold responses to non-targets. 
  - Behavioral measures of interest were the number of correct responses (i.e., correct hits for Go trials, and correct response inhibition for No-go trials) and reaction time (for Go trials only). 

- *EEG recording and data processing* 

  - To investigate the effects of tDCS, we recorded EEG using a high- density array of 128 Ag/AgCl electrodes that were embedded in soft sponges (Electrical Geodesic, EGI, Inc., Eugene, OR, USA) while subjects performed the cognitive task. 

  - Electrode impedance levels were below 50 kΩ before and after testing. 

  - The electrophysiological measures of interest were N2 and P3a for non-target stimuli (No-go condition) and P3b for target stimuli (Go condition). 

  - To obtain these components, we processed the original data as follows: 

    - (a) low pass filtering at 30 Hz; 
    - (b) segmentation of the trials from 100 ms before to 800 ms after stimulus presentation; 
    - (c) artifact detection (a difference of >140 μV between channels above and below the eyes, a difference of >55 μV between channels near the outer canthi, or one or more channels exceeding an amplitude of 200 μV); 
    - (d) re-referencing of scalp potentials to the average reference; 
    - (e) baseline correction from 100 ms before each segment. 
    - Segments that contained artifacts due to eye blinks and ocular or head movements were automatically rejected. 
    - To extract the ERPs, electrode regions and the time window for each component were based on previously published data and on the Grand Average. 
    - We extracted the mean amplitudes of N2, P3a, and P3b. 
    - We selected a time window of 150–340 ms for the N2 component and 350–500 ms for the P3a component. 
    - We used left and right frontal electrode clusters for both of these components (left: 7, 12, 13, 19, 20, 24, 29, 30/ right: 4, 5, 105, 106, 111, 112, 118, 124). 
    - We selected a time window of 300–530 ms using left and right parietal electrode clusters (left: 31, 37, 42, 52, 53, 54, 60, 61/right: 78, 79, 80, 85, 86, 87, 92, 93) for the P3b component. 

  - *Eye tracking* 

    - We analyzed eye movements during visual scanning strategies as another measurement of craving. 
    - Eye movements were recorded with Tobii eye-tracking equipment (Tobii Technology Inc., Falls Church, VA, USA), which allows analysis of saccadic movements (mean length and duration) and of fixation (localization and duration). 
    - The subjects were seated in front of a computer (50 cm from the screen) with an eye-tracking device and were asked to watch. 
    - The subjects were presented with slides that contained four different pictures (each in a different quadrant). 
    - One of the pictures was of food that was associated with craving. 
    - The position of the food picture varied across the slides. 
    - The subjects knew that no questions would be asked and that the only task was to watch pictures, and they had been informed that there were no rules and that there was not a right or wrong way to do the task. 
    - We analyzed two parameters (fixation point time, and number of fixations) as expressions of eye gaze.

  - Statistics:

    - The main outcomes of this study were N2, P3a and P3b amplitudes after craving and cues exposure (movies and food exposure) compared with sham tDCS. 

    - Other main outcomes were reaction time and accuracy (correct responses) on the Go/No-go task. We built ANOVA models for each of these main outcomes. 

    - For the electrophysiological data, the dependent variable was ERP amplitude, and the independent fixed-effect variables were condition of stimulation (active compared with sham), stimuli (food compared with furniture) and hemisphere (left compared with right). 

    - For the N2 and P3a analyses (N2ANOVA and P3aANOVA, respectively) we used only No-go trials because these ERPs are related to response inhibition. 

    - For the P3b analyses (P3bANOVA), we used only Go trials because these ERPs reflect motivational attention and responses to stimuli. 

    - For the behavioral Go/No-go task, we conducted separate analyses for No-go and Go trials. For these analyses we considered both the correct responses (for either Go or No-go trials) and reaction time (RTGoANOVA; for only Go trials) as dependent variables. 

    - For secondary outcomes, we considered the following variables and conducted the following ANOVA models: 

      • *Urge to eat*: We performed an ANOVA using VAS scores of the urge to eat as the dependent variable and regarded condition of stimulation and timepoint (arrival, after the first craving induc- tion, after tDCS treatment, after the EEG task, after the second craving induction) as independent variables. 

      • *Food smell*: A similar analysis was performed using VAS scores for smell as the dependent variable and condition of stimula- tion and timepoint (after the first and second craving induction) as independent variables. 

      • *Food appearance*: A similar analysis was performed using VAS scores for appearance as the dependent variable and condition of stimulation and timepoint (after the first and second craving induction) as independent variables. 

      • *Food taste and ingested calories*: In this analysis, taste and calories ingested were the dependent variables and only the condition of stimulation was the independent variable. There was no main effect of time because subjects were allowed to eat freely at the end of experiment. 

      • *Eye-tracking variables*: We performed an ANOVA that consid- ered the percentage of food fixation time after tDCS treatment minus pre-tDCS treatment (Post-tDCS food fixation/total screen fixation) – (Pre-tDCS food fixation/total screen fixation) as the main dependent variable. We used color (colorful compared with black and white) and tDCS (active compared with sham) as independent variables. 

### Discussion

Par 1:

- This study has two main results. 
  - First, we replicated previous findings (Fregni et al., 2008b; Goldman et al., 2011; Kekic et al., 2014) of reduced craving after active DLPFC anode right/cathode left tDCS in healthy female subjects, as measured by food intake and urge to eat. 
  - Second, we provide novel neurophysiological data that illuminate the neural mechanisms underlying these behavioral effects of tDCS on craving. 
    - Specifically, the novel finding in this study is that noninvasive brain stimulation of the DLPFC induced a significant change in the neural markers of inhibitory control as indexed by
      N2 and P3a amplitudes.

Par 2 :

- The N2 and P3a are components that are commonly detected in Go/No-go and Stop-Signal tasks and are related to inhibitory control.
  - N2 is reported as an index of conflict that occurs before the final decision to inhibit a response
  - P3a represents a late motor inhibition process, which is time-related to the decision to withhold
    the response (Albert, López-Martín, Hinojosa, & Carretié, 2013; Gajewski & Falkenstein, 2013; Schmajuk, Liotti, Busse, & Woldorff, 2006). 
  - Therefore, active tDCS over the DLPFC might have facilitated response inhibition as indexed by the trend toward N2 amplitude reduction, which would represent decreased conflict in the presence of a stimulus to which the subject must refrain to respond. 
  - Active tDCS over the DLPFC also increased P3a amplitude, which represents increased inhibition of an overt motor response. 
- These findings allow us to suggest that tDCS changed the subcortical-cortical relationship. The decreased amplitude of the N2 component indicates less conflict at the subcortical level and the increased amplitude of the P3a component indicates larger inhibitory control at the cortical level.

Par 3:

- Importantly, we showed that these findings were independent of stimuli. 
  - Our tDCS protocol might therefore have an important general effect on inhibitory control processing, which would explain previous findings of neuromodulatory effects on food craving
    and on reductions in cravings for smoking, and alcohol after similar prefrontal cortex intervention. 
  - **Anodal tDCS over the right prefrontal cortex might therefore be observed as a powerful tool to modulate impulsive behaviors.**

Par 4:

- Our electrophysiological data might therefore reflect a general improvement in inhibitory control by means of a change in the subcortical-cortical balance that favors cortical control. 
- This finding can be extended to real life situations and may therefore improve
  control over several types of stimuli, including food and drugs.
  - These results showing that tDCS can alter cortical-subcortical activation and connectivity are consistent with a recent neuroimaging study. 
  - Weber et al. (2014) showed that tDCS increased cortical excitability of the stimulated area (DLPFC) and of the anterior cingulate cortex. 
  - It also decreased cortical excitability in such subcortical and distant areas as the caudate nucleus and the orbitofrontal cortex.

Par 5: 

- We did not find improved behavioral No-go responses. There may have been a ceiling effect on controls for food cues because we collected data only from healthy subjects. 
  - Studies of patients with depression with partial remission also do not show an altered Go/ No-go response pattern even though they do present altered ERPs (Ruchsow et al., 2008). 
  - Both studies are also consistent with that of Liotti et al. (2005), which showed altered EEG patterns in ADHD subjects, even in trials of corrected inhibition. 
- It is also possible that the lack of significant effects is due to our small sample. 

Par 6:

- we also found no differences for our eye-gaze data. This result was different from that of our previous experiment (Fregni et al., 2008b), in which we showed significant alterations in food tracking. The lack of this effect in the present study might be due to a longer interval between brain stimulation and the second eye- tracking assessment in the present study compared with our previous experiment. The previous study did not include EEG recording, which made the present protocol design approximately 30 min longer. The tDCS effects could already have been diminished during the post- intervention eye-tracking task. Interestingly, food intake was still reduced by the active tDCS, which demonstrates a long-lasting effect on consumption. 

### Conclusions

- Our findings demonstrate that transcranial direct current stimulation is able to modulate food intake via modulation of inhibitory control circuitry, as indexed by N2 and P3a ERPs.
- The significant effects in our study pertained specifically to inhibitory control but not to specific stimuli, i.e., the decrease in conflict and the increase in response inhibition occurred for both food and furniture stimuli.

## Frontal cortex electrophysiology in reward- and punishment-related feedback processing during advice-guided decision making: An interleaved EEG-DC stimulation study

### Abstract

- During decision making, individuals are prone to rely on external cues such as expert advice when the outcome is not known.
  - However, the electrophysiological correlates associated with outcome uncertainty and the use of expert advice are not completely understood.
  - The feedback-related negativity (FRN), P3a, and P3b are event-related brain potentials (ERPs) linked to dissociable stages of feedback and attentional processing during decision making. 
  - Even though these ERPs are influenced by both reward- and punishment-related feedback, it remains unclear **how extrinsic information during uncertainty modulates these brain potentials.** 
- In this study, the effects of advice cues on decision making were investigated in two separate experiments. 
  - In the first experiment, electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded in healthy volunteers during a decision-making task in which the participants received reward or punishment feedback preceded by novice, amateur, or expert advice. 
    - The results showed that the P3a component was significantly influenced by the subjective predictive value of an advice cue, whereas the FRN and P3b were unaffected by the advice cues.
  -  In the second, sham-controlled experiment, cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation
    (ctDCS) was administered in conjunction with EEG in order to explore the direct contributions of the frontal cortex to these brain potentials.
    - Results showed no significant change in either advice-following behavior or decision times. 
    - However, ctDCS did decrease FRN amplitudes as compared to sham, with no effect on the P3a or P3b. 
- Together, these findings suggest that **advice information may act primarily on attention allocation during feedback processing**, whereas the electrophysiological correlates of the detection and updating of internal prediction models are not affected.

### Intro

Par 1:

- Decision Making:
  - Decision making is a multifaceted process associated with evaluating and selecting among a finite set of alternatives on the basis of probability and outcome (Lee, 2013). 
  - Both implicit and explicit forms of knowledge are used to reduce uncertainty and maximize the likelihood of making the correct choice.
  - An important source of explicit knowledge that guides decision making during uncertainty comes from expert advice. 
  - even good decision-makers remain biased toward the opinions of experts
  - The usefulness of advice is determined by its **predictive value** in terms of rewards and punishments
- Yet how **advice** affects the **cortical processing** underlying **decision making** is still poorly understood.
